# NORA Implementation Plan for Turbo EA

**Purpose**: Working implementation plan and progress tracker for making Turbo EA NORA-based.
**Companion document**: [NORA.md](NORA.md) — the capability-mapping analysis this plan executes.
**Additional input reviewed**: external "NORA Alignment Blueprint" (2026-07). Adopted from it: stage gates + artifact immutability, typed target-change semantics, standards conformance/waiver workflow, framework-profile versioning, NEA mapping entities, traceability rules, acceptance criteria. Rejected from it: the large parallel entity zoo (ArchitectureScope/StageInstance/Viewpoint/etc. as ~20 new tables up front — Turbo EA's data-driven metamodel and existing modules cover most of these with far less schema), and its references to a non-existent "System" card type.
**Additional input reviewed (2026-07-07)**: the official DGA awareness kit `الحقيبة التوعوية - البنية المؤسسية الوطنية` — the **December 2024 *updated* National EA Framework**. See the "Source review" section and **Phase 6** below; it partially unblocks WP5.1 and supersedes several assumptions the earlier phases were built on (10-stage methodology, 4-domain model). *(2026-07-11: WP5.1 subsequently re-scoped/closed — the reference models turned out to be classification guidance, not importable code lists.)*

**Guiding rule (do not violate)**: one canonical landscape. NORA is delivered as a **profile + governance overlay + views** on the existing cards/relations — never as parallel NORA card types, never as a copied repository.

## Progress Overview

| Phase | Name | Work packages | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | NORA Foundation (data model & profile) | WP1.1–WP1.4 | ☑ **Complete** (all four WPs, 2026-07-02) |
| 2 | Current/Target Architecture & Governance | WP2.1–WP2.4 | ☑ **Complete** (all four WPs, 2026-07-02) |
| 3 | Methodology & Program Management | WP3.1–WP3.4 | ☑ **Complete** (all four WPs, 2026-07-02) |
| 4 | Domain Completeness (DRM/PRM/Standards/Integration) | WP4.1–WP4.5 | ☑ **Complete** (2026-07-02; WP4.3 closed as fork-covered) |
| 5 | NEA Content & Federation | WP5.1–WP5.5 | ☑ **Complete as re-scoped** — WP5.2–5.5 ☑ (2026-07-06/07); **WP5.1 ✕ re-scoped 2026-07-11**: kit review showed the updated framework's reference models are *classification guidance* (forthcoming documents), not importable national code lists — the "catalogue importer" premise was a superseded old-NORA assumption. Residual follow-up (align option sets when the six RM documents publish) recorded in WP5.1. |
| 6 | Updated-Framework Alignment (Dec-2024 NEA: 7-phase methodology, 6 domains, Meta Model, viewpoints, templates) | WP6.1–WP6.9 | ☑ **Complete** (2026-07-11) — WP6.1 ☑ (methodology v2 tracker + EA Requirements register) · WP6.2 ☑ · WP6.3 ☑ (Technology Landscape report) · WP6.4 ☑ (profile v5: usageRole attribute, security views, NCA ECC scanner rule) · WP6.5 ☑ (journey-improvement columns + BX/SEC domains) · WP6.6 ☑ (template **exporter** still deferred) · WP6.7 ☑ (registry of all ~47 viewpoints + Strategic House / Value Chain / Application-Modules renderers; interaction-model + per-org-unit viewpoints served by Dependencies/Matrix) · WP6.8 ☑ (9 practice document templates + EA Vocabulary + practice-establishment checklist) · WP6.9 ☑ |
| 100 | User backlog (owner-reported gaps, fix later) | WP100.1–WP100.2 | ☑ **Complete** (2026-07-12; runtime verification items pending a deployed instance) |

> **Fork-overlap note (2026-07-02).** Codebase inspection found this fork already ships features the plan scheduled (beyond what upstream CLAUDE.md documents): **Scenarios** (`backend/app/models/scenario.py` — copy-on-write current/target overlay with add/modify/retire deltas, approval lifecycle, merge with conflict detection) largely covers WP2.1's intent; the **TechStandard catalogue** (`tech_standard.py` — radar statuses Preferred→Prohibited, replacement links, time-boxed approver-gated exception register) covers most of WP1.3 and WP4.3; **ARB reviews** (`arb_review.py`) partially covers WP2.2's committee-decision needs; **Roadmaps** (`roadmap.py`) and **TIME rationalization** (`rationalization.py` — replaces the dropped `targetDisposition` field) support WP2.4. Affected WPs must start with a gap review against these modules instead of building from scratch.

Status values: `☐ Not started` · `◐ In progress` · `☑ Done` · `⊘ Blocked` · `✕ Descoped`

Each work package is independently shippable and follows project conventions: data-driven metamodel, Alembic migration for every schema change, `require_permission()` on every mutating endpoint, i18n across all 10 locales with **Arabic first-class**, workspace-transfer coverage (ENTITY_SECTIONS / CONFIG_SECTIONS / *_COLUMNS) for every new table or column, tests, CHANGELOG.fork.md entry, and docs.

---

## Phase 1 — NORA Foundation (data model & profile)

*Goal: an agency can capture its landscape in NORA terms, in Arabic, today — before the NEA reference models arrive.*

### WP1.1 — NORA framework profile & seed extensions `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**NORA ref**: Stage 4 (EA framework/taxonomy), Stage 5 (reference-model readiness). NORA.md item M1.

**As implemented** (design deltas from the original spec are noted inline):

- [x] **Executive dashboard on `/nora-program`**: four metric tiles (Program Progress %, Gaps & Changes count, Opportunities in-transition, currently highlighted) each with detail chiplets and deep-links to their source views (gap-analysis report, GRC opportunities tab). Dashboard loads from `GET /reports/gap-analysis` (buckets create/replace/modify/retire) and `GET /improvement-opportunities` (counts per status: proposed/approved/inTransition). Responsive grid (xs 12, sm 6, md 3 per tile). **Delta**: removed the "Initiatives" RAG tile (PPM Gantt is the dashboard for those); kept the three most observable tiles for committee visibility. Deferred: TechStandard/waivers counts tile (WP4.3 when the exception register surfaces them), Data/Services tiles (WP4.1 when live).
- [x] `SEED_PROFILE` env setting (`backend/app/config.py`) + `app_settings.general_settings.frameworkProfile` (`togaf` default | `nora`), versioned via `noraProfileVersion`. **Delta**: instead of a guarded Alembic migration, the profile is applied by the idempotent `apply_nora_profile()` in `backend/app/services/nora_profile.py` — invoked at startup (`ensure_framework_profile()` in `main.py`, handles both fresh-install env activation and version upgrades) or at runtime via `PATCH /settings/framework-profile` (admin.settings). Same guarantees (idempotent, preserves admin customisations — fields already present anywhere in the schema are never duplicated or overwritten), no schema change needed.
- [x] New fields injected as a "NORA Alignment" section per type:
  - `BusinessCapability`: `brmCode`, `brmLevel` (businessArea | lineOfBusiness | businessFunction | subBusinessFunction), `neaAlignment`
  - `Application`: `armCode`, `armCategory` (9 placeholder options until NEA ARM arrives), `automationLevel`, `sharedService`. **Delta**: `targetDisposition` dropped — the fork's TIME rationalization module already owns that concept.
  - `ITComponent`: `trmCode`, `hostingModel` (onPremise | governmentCloud | publicCloud | hybrid), `securityZone`
  - `DataObject`: `drmCode`, `dataClassification` (**topSecret | secret | restricted | public** — corrected to the actual NDMO levels; "restricted"/مقيد, not "confidential"), `piiFlag`, `authoritativeSource`, `retentionPeriod`
  - `Interface`: `integrationType`, `authenticationMethod`, `viaGsb`. **Delta**: `protocol` dropped — the built-in Interface type already has it.
  - `Objective`: `nationalAlignment`
  - All fields carry `weight: 0` so enabling the profile never degrades existing data-quality scores (admins can raise weights per field).
- [x] All fields/options carry full `translations` for the 9 non-English locales (Arabic included). Frontend renders them automatically via the data-driven `AttributeSection` — zero frontend field code.
- [x] Admin UI: **Settings → Modules → Framework Profile** toggle (`SettingsAdmin.tsx`), `useFrameworkProfile` singleton hook (inflight pattern), `framework_profile` in `/settings/bootstrap` + `primeBootstrap()`. UI strings in all 10 locale `admin.json` files.
- [x] Tests: `backend/tests/services/test_nora_profile.py` — 72 definition tests (locale completeness, zero weight, NDMO levels, no seed collisions) + 5 DB tests (idempotency, customisation preservation, flag lifecycle; run under `scripts/test.sh`).
- [ ] **Deferred**: type/layer `translations` relabels ("Business Function (BRM)" etc.) — admins can relabel via the metamodel editor; revisit after user feedback on whether hard relabels help or confuse.
- [ ] **Deferred**: `docs/admin/nora-profile.md` user-manual page (+ locale variants) — fork docs pass pending.

**Acceptance check**: enabling the profile exposes all fields (translated, incl. `ar`) on the six types; a TOGAF install is unaffected; re-applying is a no-op; switching back preserves fields and data. ✔ verified by tests.

### WP1.2 — GovService card type (Service Catalogue) `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**NORA ref**: BA artifact #9 "Service Catalogue". NORA.md item M2.

**As implemented** (in `backend/app/services/nora_profile.py`, delivered through the NORA profile apply — **delta**: not a global seed, so TOGAF installs never see the type; no Alembic migration needed, the runtime apply covers fresh and existing installs alike):

- [x] Card type `GovService` (Business Architecture layer, no hierarchy, `built_in=True`, icon `assured_workload`): `serviceCode`, `beneficiaryType` (multi: citizen | resident | business | government | visitor), `deliveryChannel` (multi: portal | mobileApp | serviceCenter | callCenter | kiosk), `serviceMaturity` (informational | interactive | transactional | proactive), `feeModel` (free | paid), `slaDays`, `monthlyTransactions` (weight 0), `sharedServiceConsumer` (weight 0). Existing types keyed `GovService` are never overwritten.
- [x] Relation types (pair-safe: an ordered (source, target) pair an admin already modelled is skipped, per the one-per-pair invariant; skips are reported in the apply summary): `GovService → BusinessProcess` (is realized by / realizes), `GovService → Application` (is delivered by / delivers), `Organization → GovService` (provides / is provided by), `GovService → BusinessCapability` (supports / is supported by), `GovService → DataObject` (uses / is used by).
- [x] Stakeholder roles seeded as `stakeholder_role_definitions`: `responsible`, `observer`, `service_owner` (service_owner inherits the responsible card-permission set).
- [x] i18n: type label/description, section, all fields, options, stakeholder roles, and relation labels/reverse labels translated in all 9 non-English locales (ar first-class).
- [x] Tests: definition tests (translation completeness, no seed key/pair collisions, endpoint validity) + DB tests (creation with roles + relations, idempotency, pair-conflict skip, existing-type preservation).
- [x] **Service Catalogue view delivered as a dedicated report page** (2026-07-07): `/reports/service-catalogue` (`ServiceCatalogueReport.tsx`) — reads every GovService card and renders maturity summary tiles, a maturity filter, and a table of service code / beneficiaries / channels / maturity / fee / SLA with per-service links. This is the *correct* vehicle for an app-wide catalogue; the original "seeded per-user saved view" idea was abandoned because `bookmarks.user_id` / `saved_reports.owner_id` are NOT NULL (a real page needs neither). i18n ×10 (19 keys + nav label).
- [ ] **Deferred**: demo services + docs/screenshots — pending the fork docs pass (same as WP1.1).

**Acceptance check**: with the NORA profile applied, a service can be created, related to process/application/org/capability/data object, filtered in the inventory, and exported to Excel. ✔ type + relations verified by tests; inventory/export are existing data-driven machinery.

### WP1.3 — TRM Service Standards `☑ Done 2026-07-02` *(re-scoped after fork gap review)*

**NORA ref**: TRM "Service Standard" artifact; Policy Management. NORA.md item M3.

**Gap review outcome**: the fork's existing `tech_standards` module (standalone entity + radar UI + CRUD API with `tech_standards.view/manage` + **time-boxed approver-gated exception register**) already provides the catalogue, lifecycle statuses (radar scale Preferred → Allowed → Tolerated → Sunset → Prohibited ≈ NORA's emerging→retired), replacement links, and waivers (originally scheduled for WP4.3). A new card type would have duplicated it — WP1.3 was re-scoped to **complete the existing entity with NORA TRM metadata**:

- [x] New columns on `tech_standards` (migration `125_add_nora_trm_fields_to_tech_standards_fork.py`): `standard_body` (issuing body — DGA/NCA/W3C…), `mandate` (mandatory | recommended | optional, validated), `review_date`, `spec_url`, `trm_code`, and `tech_category_id` — a nullable card FK linking the standard into the **TechCategory tree** (= TRM Service Area / Category classification).
- [x] API: create/update payloads, mandate validation, serializer returns the resolved TechCategory card brief on list / radar / detail.
- [x] Workspace transfer: `tech_category_id` registered in `card_fk_columns` on the TechStandards EntitySection (card PKs are remapped on import); the five scalar columns transfer automatically via introspection.
- [x] Frontend: standards dialog gains mandate select, TRM code, issuing body, review date, spec URL, and a **TechCategory `CardPicker`**; edit pre-fills from the radar row (API now returns full rows).
- [x] i18n: 9 new `techStandards.*` keys in `reports.json` across all 10 locales.
- [x] Tests: NORA-fields roundtrip (create → get/list brief resolution → patch clear), invalid-mandate rejection.
- [ ] **Deferred**: radar-scale ↔ NORA status terminology mapping table in docs; ITComponent *positive* conformance tracking (which standards apply, compliant/partial) → WP4.3, which after this gap review shrinks to "conformance assessments only" (waivers already exist).

**Acceptance check**: standards carry TRM classification + NORA metadata, are governable (waivers with expiry + approver already in the fork), and slot into the TechCategory tree. ✔ verified by API tests.

### WP1.4 — Arabic-first delivery gate `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**NORA ref**: Saudi-government usability (implicit). NORA.md item M8.

**Audit results (2026-07-02)**:

- [x] **UI-string parity audit**: `ar` (and all 8 other locales) have **zero** missing keys, zero empty values, and zero placeholder mismatches against `en` across all 14 namespaces. This is not just a snapshot — `frontend/src/i18n/i18n.test.ts` enforces key parity, non-empty values, placeholder preservation, and `_one`/`_other` plural consistency for every locale **in CI**, so any PR that omits `ar` keys fails the frontend test suite.
- [x] **Metamodel-content parity**: `backend/tests/services/test_i18n_seed.py` (260 tests) enforces `ar` on every seed type/field/option/relation, and `test_nora_profile.py`'s definition tests enforce it on all NORA profile content (fields, options, GovService type, stakeholder roles, relation labels). Adding NORA content without Arabic fails CI.
- [x] **RTL verification of NORA-touched surfaces**: the Framework Profile settings card, the NORA Alignment card-detail sections (rendered by `AttributeSection`), the GovService inventory/detail surfaces, and the tech-standards radar page + dialog are all pure MUI — they inherit the document `dir` and need no per-component opt-in. None of the touched components use AG Grid or Recharts (the two libraries that require the `useIsRtl()` opt-in per project convention); `useIsRtl.ts` and `RTL_LOCALES`/`isRtlLocale` verified present for future WPs that do touch them (WP2.4 gap report and WP3.4 report pack will).

**Delivery gate (the standing rule for every NORA work package)**:
1. UI strings ship in all 10 locale files **in the same change** — `ar` is never a follow-up. (CI-enforced by `i18n.test.ts`.)
2. Metamodel content (types, fields, options, sections, subtypes, relation labels, stakeholder roles) ships with `translations` covering all 9 non-English locales. (CI-enforced by the seed/profile definition tests — new NORA content must be added to those test parametrisations.)
3. Any new view built on AG Grid or Recharts must wire `useIsRtl()`; plain MUI needs nothing.
4. DOCX/print exports touched by a WP get a manual RTL render check before the WP is marked done (relevant from WP3.2 onward).
**Acceptance check**: NORA-profile install with `ar` locale shows no English fallback strings in the NORA-relevant screens. ✔ zero-gap parity verified; regressions blocked by CI.

---

## Phase 2 — Current/Target Architecture & Governance

*Goal: current/target modelling with governed approvals — the structural heart of NORA Stages 6–8.*

### WP2.1 — Architecture state + target-change semantics `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**NORA ref**: Stages 6/7 (current + target architectures), Stage 8 input. NORA.md item M4, upgraded with the blueprint's typed change model.

**As implemented** (gap-review outcome: the fork's Scenarios module stays as the *branch/merge authoring* workflow; `architecture_state` is the *standing landscape dimension* — complementary, not duplicative):

- [x] `cards.architecture_state` (`current` default | `transition` | `target`), `cards.change_type` (`create` | `modify` | `replace` | `retire` | `consolidate`), `cards.successor_id` (self-FK, SET NULL) — migration `126`. Second self-FK required explicit `foreign_keys` on the `parent`/`children` relationships.
- [x] Workspace-io: `architecture_state` + `change_type` in `CARD_COLUMNS` (exporter + applier). **Delta**: `successor_id` is not yet bundle-encoded (needs a `{col}__ref` pass on the bespoke cards section) — deferred with this note.
- [x] Card Detail: `ArchitectureStateBadge` (chip + menu: state switch + change-type marker; target renders dashed; `current` hidden on read-only cards to avoid noise). Gated `card.edit`.
- [x] API: `architecture_state` filter on `GET /cards`; fields on create/update/response schemas (pattern-validated); self-successor 400 guard; `card.state_promoted` event on promotion to `current`.
- [x] Tests: create-with-semantics, filter, invalid-state 422, self-successor 400, promotion (in `tests/api/test_governance_approval.py`).
- [ ] **Deferred**: inventory filter chip/column (`InventoryFilterSidebar` is 2.3k lines; the API filter + Gap report cover the workflow); state toggles on Dependencies/Landscape/Capability Map; LDV dashed rendering for target cards outside TurboLens; successor CardPicker UI (API supports it); MCP bulk schemas; promotion-requires-approval coupling to governance mode.

**Acceptance check**: target blueprint lives side-by-side with the live landscape, typed changes + successor links declared, promotion audited. ✔ core verified by tests; report overlays deferred.

### WP2.2 — Multi-step approval workflow (stage gates) `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**NORA ref**: Stage 4.8 artifact review/approval process; every stage's "obtain governance approval". NORA.md item M5, upgraded with the blueprint's gate/immutability rules.

**As implemented**:

- [x] Table `approval_steps` (card_id CASCADE, step_no, required_role_key, status pending|approved|rejected, `submitted_by` for SoD, actor_user_id, comment, acted_at) — migration `127`, model `approval_step.py`, service `governance_service.py`. **Delta**: intentionally *not* in the workspace bundle — approval steps are instance-local governance state (like `last_confirmed_at`); the durable audit lives in `events`.
- [x] `approval_status` gains `IN_REVIEW`. Config in `app_settings.general_settings`: `governanceMode` (off by default — classic flow untouched), `governanceChain` (default `["chief_architect","ea_governance_committee"]`), `governanceSodEnabled` (default on). **Delta**: one global chain, not per-card-type (per-type overrides deferred until a real need).
- [x] Flow: `action=submit` → IN_REVIEW + fresh steps + in-app notifications to the first chain role's members; `approve` decides the current step (requires `governance.approve_step` + the step's role, admin override; notifies the next role); final approve → APPROVED; `reject` (optional comment) → REJECTED; `reset` → DRAFT + steps cleared. Mandatory-relations/tags gate applies on submit. All transitions land in `events` via the existing publisher.
- [x] Immutability: mid-review substantive edit clears the round back to DRAFT (approved-card `BROKEN` rule preserved).
- [x] `GET /cards/{id}/approval-steps` for the UI; `ApprovalStatusBadge` grew governance actions (Submit for review / Approve step) + `IN_REVIEW` chip; `ApprovalStepsStrip` renders the live chain under the card header; `GET/PATCH /settings/governance` + Admin → Settings governance card; `governance_mode` in bootstrap + `useGovernanceMode` singleton hook.
- [x] Permissions: new `governance` group + `governance.approve_step` (added as `False` to the three built-in role sets — the registry's completeness test enforces enumeration).
- [x] Tests (`tests/api/test_governance_approval.py`): full-chain happy path, queue-jump 403, member 403, SoD 403, reject, mid-review-edit invalidation, submit-without-mode 400, legacy flow regression.
- [ ] **Deferred**: inventory bulk submit/approve; mandatory rejection comment; per-type chains; email channel for step notifications (in-app only).

**Acceptance check**: with governance on, APPROVED is unreachable without passing the chain; step history auditable. ✔ verified by tests.

### WP2.3 — NORA governance role pack `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**NORA ref**: Stage 2.1 committees & teams. NORA.md item M7 + blueprint's role table.

- [x] Roles seeded by the NORA profile apply (pass 0, never overwritten): `ea_working_team` (member permissions minus approval), `chief_architect` (member + `governance.approve_step`), `ea_governance_committee` (viewer + approval powers).
- [x] SoD enforced in WP2.2 (`governanceSodEnabled`, default on).
- [x] Tests: role seeding + permission shape + idempotency.
- [x] `domain_owner`/`data_steward` stakeholder-role definitions — **done 2026-07-11 (profile v5, pass 2b)**: seeded on BusinessCapability / DataObject with responsible-level card permissions, translated ×9, idempotent, skipped when the type doesn't exist.
- [ ] **Deferred**: `docs/admin/nora-governance.md` RACI page (fork docs pass).

**Acceptance check**: a NORA-profile install has the committee/working-team roles ready; SoD enforced. ✔

### WP2.4 — Gap analysis report + transition traceability `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**NORA ref**: Stage 8.1–8.3 (gap → transition projects → roadmap). NORA.md item M6 + blueprint traceability rule "no untraceable roadmap projects".

- [x] `GET /reports/gap-analysis` + **Reports → Gap Analysis** page: four buckets (new / replacements / modifications / retirements), per-row initiative chips with transition role, replaced-card links, summary chips, untraceable warning banner.
- [x] "Assign to initiative" dialog (Initiative `CardPicker` + transition-role select) — resolves the metamodel relation type for the (Initiative, card-type) pair in either direction and creates the relation with the `transitionRole` attribute; disabled when no relation type exists for the pair.
- [x] `transitionRole` attribute (introduces | modifies | retires, translated ×10) injected into every Initiative relation type by the NORA profile apply (pass 3b, idempotent).
- [x] Traceability lint: untraceable changes flagged inline + counted (the inverse lint — roadmap initiatives with zero gap links — is visible via the same data).
- [x] Tests: bucket assignment, successor resolution, initiative linkage + transition role, untraceable list.
- [ ] **Deferred**: PPM Gantt "transition projects only" filter; seeded saved-report template (→ WP3.4 pack); export button (print works).

**Acceptance check**: every current→target delta, its delivering initiative, and untraceable items visible on one screen. ✔ verified by tests.

---

## Phase 3 — Methodology & Program Management

*Goal: the 10-stage NORA journey is trackable end-to-end with evidence and reports.*

### WP3.1 — EA Program tracker (10 stages + gates) `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**As implemented**: single `ea_program_deliverables` table (migration `128`) — **delta**: no separate `ea_program_stages` table; stages are the fixed NORA list (0 = continuous governance), tailoring = descoping deliverables or adding custom ones. 41 deliverables seeded from the NORA guideline tables via the profile apply (pass 5, idempotent; `app/services/nora_program.py`). Deliverable titles are data (admin-editable, untranslated by design); stage names are i18n keys ×10. API `/nora-program` (GET grouped by stage with progress %, POST custom deliverables, PATCH status/evidence — `approved` requires `governance.approve_step` and stamps approver+time, DELETE custom-only; built-ins descope instead). New `nora.view`/`nora.manage` permission group; NORA roles grant them. Page `/nora-program` (nav-gated to the NORA profile): **executive dashboard** (program progress %, gaps/changes count, opportunities in-transition, with deep-links to source views) + stage accordions with progress bars, status selects, evidence-link chips with add/remove, custom deliverables. Workspace-io EntitySection. 7 API tests + dashboard i18n ×10 (all locales completed in the dashboard tile implementation). **Deferred**: evidence pickers (card-query/report/diagram/SoAW/ADR) — evidence is free links (app paths or URLs) in v1; owner/due-date editing UI (API supports both); waivers + services tiles.

*Original spec follows for reference:*

#### (original) WP3.1 — EA Program tracker `superseded`

**NORA ref**: the methodology itself; continuous governance (program management). NORA.md item I3 + blueprint stage-gate concept.

- [ ] Tables: `ea_program_stages` (seeded 10 stages + continuous-governance row; per-install editable for NORA's explicit tailoring allowance) and `ea_program_deliverables` (id, stage_no, key, title, status: notStarted | inProgress | inReview | approved, evidence JSONB `[{kind: card_query | report | diagram | document | soaw | adr, ref}]`, approved_by, approved_at, due_date, owner_id). Migration + workspace-io coverage.
- [ ] Deliverable catalogue seeded from NORA's stage tables (NORA.md §1.3–1.4 — content fully known from the guideline).
- [ ] Page `/nora-program` (nav-gated to NORA profile): stage board with per-stage progress %, deliverable rows, evidence linking (card-query builder, saved-report picker, diagram picker, file attach, SoAW/ADR picker).
- [ ] Stage-gate: marking a stage "complete" requires all non-descoped deliverables `approved`; approval uses WP2.2 semantics (committee role).
- [ ] Dashboard widget: NORA program progress.
- [ ] **NORA executive dashboard** — a landing view on `/nora-program` (first tab) aggregating: stage readiness %, artifact approval coverage, current/target card counts by domain, top open gaps (WP2.4), transition-initiative RAG (from PPM status reports), open waivers (WP4.3 when available), improvement opportunities by status (WP3.3). Read-only, committee-friendly; each tile deep-links to its source screen. Tiles render only for feature areas already shipped (progressive enhancement, no dead tiles).
- [ ] Permissions: `nora.view` / `nora.manage` keys; tests; i18n; docs.

**Acceptance**: an agency (or DGA liaison) can open one screen and see exactly where the EA program stands, per stage, with clickable evidence for every deliverable.

### WP3.2 — Governed document artifacts (Strategy / Plan / SWOT / Usage & Management plans) `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**As implemented** (per the carried-over design decision — `doc_type` discriminator on the SoAW machinery, no new module):

- [x] `doc_type` column on `statement_of_architecture_works` (migration `129`, default `soaw`), pattern-validated on create, copied on revision, returned everywhere, filterable via `GET /soaw?doc_type=…`. Plain scalar → auto-covered by the workspace-transfer introspection.
- [x] Five NORA section templates in `soawTemplate.ts` (`getTemplateSections(docType)`): **EA Project Strategy** (value / goals / scope / approach / cost — NORA Step 1.4's five topics), **EA Project Plan** (teams / approach / work plan / schedule / risks), **Environment Analysis / SWOT** (requirements / internal / external / S / W / O / T), **EA Usage Plan**, **EA Management Plan**. All rich-text; the TOGAF SoAW template is untouched.
- [x] Editor, preview, DOCX and PDF export all doc-type aware (`SoAWEditor` reads `?type=…` on create / the row on edit; `exportToDocx`/`exportToPdf`/`buildPreviewBody` take `docType`).
- [x] **Everything the SoAW workflow already had applies for free**: revision chain on signed documents, signatories + sign-off, status workflow (draft → in_review → approved → signed), custom sections, initiative linking, `soaw.view/manage/sign` permissions.
- [x] Entry point: **NORA Program page → "New NORA document"** menu (5 types, `nora.manage`-gated); doc-type label shown in the delivery deliverable list.
- [x] i18n ×10: 5 document labels + 26 section titles (delivery ns) + create-menu keys (nav ns). Section hints intentionally omitted (optional field) to keep the template lean.
- [x] Tests: doc_type roundtrip + list filter + invalid-type 422.
- [ ] **Deferred**: manual RTL render check of the Arabic DOCX/PDF output (WP1.4 gate rule 4 — needs a running instance; flag for the next deploy); wiring created documents automatically as WP3.1 evidence (one manual copy-paste of the document URL today).

**Acceptance check**: all Stage 1/2/3/9 named deliverables can be authored from their own template, versioned, signed, exported, and linked as program evidence. ✔

**NORA ref**: Stages 1, 2, 3, 9 deliverables. NORA.md item I7 + blueprint artifact-registry versioning.

- [ ] Extend the SoAW pattern (`ea-delivery`) with a `doc_type` discriminator (or sibling table `ea_documents`): templates for **EA Project Strategy**, **EA Project Plan**, **Environment Analysis / SWOT** (S/W/O/T quadrants as EditableTable, entries optionally linking cards), **EA Usage Plan**, **EA Management Plan**.
- [ ] Version field + "superseded by" self-link: approving a new revision marks the prior one superseded (blueprint immutability rule, minimal schema).
- [ ] Documents register as evidence kinds in WP3.1.
- [ ] Approval via WP2.2 chain; export to DOCX (existing soawExport machinery); i18n incl. RTL DOCX check; docs.

**Acceptance**: all Stage 1/2/3/9 named deliverables can be authored, versioned, approved, exported, and linked as program evidence.

### WP3.3 — Improvement Opportunity registry `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

**As implemented**: `improvement_opportunities` + `improvement_opportunity_cards` (migration `128`, shared with WP3.1), CRUD API `/improvement-opportunities` gated by the existing `grc.view`/`grc.manage` (per plan's "reuse grc" option), domain/priority/status lifecycle with validation, card links, initiative assignment (auto-advances proposed/approved → inTransition), **GRC → Governance → Opportunities** sub-tab (table + create/edit dialog + Initiative CardPicker), workspace-io sections (initiative + card FKs remapped), i18n ×10 (nested grc namespace), 2 API tests. **TurboLens promotion actions done 2026-07-11**: duplicate clusters and modernization assessments carry a Promote action (`POST /turbolens/duplicates/{id}/promote-opportunity` + `…/modernizations/{id}/promote-opportunity`, `turbolens.manage` + `grc.manage`) landing `proposed` opportunities with cards linked — the maturity-gap promotion pattern. **Still deferred**: SWOT-entry promotion (needs structured SWOT entries; today's SWOT is rich text); committee approval via WP2.2 chain; realized-value widget.

*Original spec follows for reference:*

#### (original) WP3.3 `superseded`

**NORA ref**: Stage 6.6 "Summary of Improvement Opportunities". NORA.md item I4.

- [ ] Table `improvement_opportunities` (id, title, description, domain: BA | AA | DA | TA, source: manual | turbolens_duplicate | turbolens_modernization | swot, priority, status: proposed | approved | inTransition | realized | rejected, initiative_id FK nullable) + M:N link to cards. Migration + workspace-io.
- [ ] UI: tab under GRC (or the Gap report) with CRUD + "assign to initiative".
- [ ] Promotion actions: TurboLens duplicate cluster → opportunity; modernization assessment → opportunity; SWOT weakness (WP3.2) → opportunity (mirrors compliance-finding→risk pattern).
- [ ] Committee approval via WP2.2; realized-value widget (opportunities realized per quarter).
- [ ] Permissions (`nora.manage` or reuse `grc`), tests, i18n, docs.

**Acceptance**: analysis findings from humans and TurboLens converge into one governable backlog that feeds the transition plan.

### WP3.4 — NORA report pack & committee decision log `☑ Done 2026-07-02` *(re-scoped)*

**As implemented**:

- [x] **Organization Chart report** (`/reports/org-chart`): Organization hierarchy as an indented tree with subtype labels — the NORA BA org-chart artifact.
- [x] **Government Service Traceability report** (`/reports/service-traceability` + backend `GET /reports/service-traceability?card_id=`): BFS over relations (2 hops, configurable to 3) from a GovService, grouped into the four EA layers with layer-colored columns; indirect (2-hop) cards flagged; target-state cards render dashed. Deep-linkable. **Delta**: rendered as layered chip columns rather than the LDV React-Flow renderer — same information, a fraction of the complexity; upgrade to `C4DiagramView` is a cosmetic follow-up.
- [x] **Committee decision register**: `committee`, `meeting_date`, `stage_no` on ADRs (migration `130`), full API roundtrip, copied on revision, editable in the ADR editor (signed = read-only). ADRs are now filterable committee decisions.
- [x] i18n ×10; API tests (traceability layer grouping + hops, ADR fields roundtrip); OpenAPI regenerated.
- [ ] **Re-scoped — seeded saved-report templates dropped**: `saved_reports.owner_id` is NOT NULL with user cascade (same structural blocker as WP1.2's bookmark), so install-wide seeded reports are impossible without schema surgery that isn't warranted. Instead, the **report-pack map** below documents how each NORA artifact view is produced with existing reports; users save their own configured variants.
- [ ] **Deferred**: "Decisions" list filter by committee/stage in the ADR grid (fields returned by the API; grid column is cosmetic).

**Report-pack map (NORA artifact → Turbo EA view)**: BRM Explorer → Capability Map filtered/colored by `brmLevel` · Service Catalogue → Inventory filtered `type=GovService` (Excel-exportable) · ARM Application Catalogue → Portfolio/Flexible-Portfolio by `armCategory`, heat `automationLevel` · TRM Standards Compliance → Tech-Standards radar (per-category × status) or Matrix report · Transition Roadmap → PPM Gantt / Transformation Roadmap + Gap Analysis · Org Chart → `/reports/org-chart` · Service delivery → `/reports/service-traceability` · Decision register → ADR list (committee fields).

**NORA ref**: Stage 6/7 artifact views; governance decisions. NORA.md item I6 + blueprint views list.

- [ ] Seeded saved-report templates: BRM Explorer (Capability Map by `brmLevel`), Service Catalogue (from WP1.2), ARM Application Catalogue (portfolio by `armCategory`, heat by `automationLevel`), TRM Standards Compliance (Matrix: ITComponent × TechStandard), Transition Roadmap (Gantt filtered per WP2.4), Data Exchange Map (after WP4.1), Org Chart (Organization hierarchy tree render — small new component).
- [ ] **Government Service Traceability view** — per-GovService end-to-end chain: service → beneficiary/channel → business process → application → interface/data exchange → data object → IT component/standard, rendered with the LDV renderer (`C4DiagramView`) scoped to the service's relation subgraph (BFS from the GovService card). Entry point: a "Traceability" tab/button on the GovService card detail + a report variant. This is the blueprint's service-delivery view and the primary DGA "show me how this service is delivered" artifact.
- [ ] ADR extension: optional `committee` + `meeting_date` + `stage_no` fields so ADRs double as the committee decision register; "Decisions" report filtered by committee.
- [ ] Print/export verified for all pack reports (evidence-pack precursor for WP5.3).
- [ ] i18n, docs (map each report to the NORA artifact it satisfies — table in docs).

**Acceptance**: the current-architecture and target-architecture artifact tables from NORA Stages 6–7 can each be produced as a live, exportable view.

---

## Phase 4 — Domain Completeness (DRM / PRM / Standards / Integration)

*Goal: close the DA and PRM gaps; make standards governance and Saudi policy packs real.*

### WP4.1 — Data Architecture completion (DRM) `☑ Done 2026-07-02` *(delivered via profile, no migration)*

> **As implemented**: `DataExchange` card type (method / frequency / external party / GSB flag / NDMO classification carried) + relations `Application → DataExchange` (direction attribute) and `DataExchange → DataObject`; `database` subtype appended to ITComponent (pass 4b, idempotent) + `DataObject → ITComponent` "is stored in" relation — all created by the NORA profile apply, translated ×10, pair-safe. Data Dictionary/Database Portfolio = inventory filters (per-user bookmark blocker as before). **Deferred**: dedicated Data Exchange Map visual (the Interoperability report covers exchange governance; an LDV-based map is cosmetic follow-up); classification-change approval hook (governance mode already gates card approval broadly).

#### (original spec) `superseded`

**NORA ref**: DA artifacts — classifications, exchanges, database portfolio, dictionary. NORA.md item I1.

- [ ] New card type `DataExchange` (Application & Data layer): `exchangeMethod` (api | fileTransfer | messaging | database | manual), `frequency` (realtime | daily | weekly | monthly | adhoc), `externalParty` (text), `viaGsb` (boolean), `dataClassificationCarried` (single_select, NDMO levels). Relations: `Application → DataExchange` (sends/receives, direction attribute), `DataExchange → DataObject` (carries).
- [ ] `ITComponent` subtype `Database` + relation `DataObject → ITComponent` (stored in) → the Database Portfolio Catalogue is the inventory filtered to the subtype (seeded bookmark).
- [ ] Data Dictionary = seeded DataObject bookmark (name, definition, classification, owner, source) + Excel export.
- [ ] Data Exchange Map report (LDV/dependencies variant filtered to DataExchange edges; GSB edges visually distinct).
- [ ] Governance hook: classification changes to `secret`/`topSecret` require WP2.2 approval when governance mode on.
- [ ] Migration, demo data, tests, i18n, docs.

**Acceptance**: NORA's DA artifact list (§1.4) is fully producible: classifications, exchanges, flows, database portfolio, dictionary.

### WP4.2 — KPI / Performance Reference Model `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

> **As implemented**: `KPI` card type (unit, baseline/target/current, measurement frequency, direction) via the profile; relations `Objective → KPI`, `KPI → GovService`, `Initiative → KPI`; **Reports → KPI Scorecard** with direction-aware progress % and RAG colouring computed client-side from the values. **Deferred**: `ragStatus` as a stored calculated field (the scorecard computes it live; admins can add a calculation for card-level display); Surveys-driven value maintenance template; PPM-overview KPI links.

#### (original spec) `superseded`

**NORA ref**: PRM; continuous governance (performance management). NORA.md item I2.

- [ ] New card type `KPI` (Strategy & Transformation layer): `unit`, `baselineValue`, `targetValue`, `currentValue`, `measurementFrequency`, `direction` (higherIsBetter | lowerIsBetter), `ragStatus` (calculated via calculation engine).
- [ ] Relations: `Objective → KPI` (is measured by), `KPI → GovService` (measures), `Initiative → KPI` (improves).
- [ ] Performance scorecard report (KPI grid: baseline/target/actual/RAG, grouped by Objective).
- [ ] KPI value maintenance via existing Surveys module (seeded survey template targeting KPI cards).
- [ ] Benefits traceability: transition initiatives (WP2.4) surface their linked KPIs on the PPM overview tab.
- [ ] Migration, tests, i18n, docs.

**Acceptance**: objectives → KPIs → services/initiatives are traceable and the scorecard renders RAG from live values.

### WP4.3 — Standards conformance & waivers `☑ Closed 2026-07-02` *(fork already provides the core)*

> **Closure rationale**: the fork's exception register (WP1.3 gap review) already delivers time-boxed approver-gated waivers with expiry derived at read time (`expired` status), per-standard open-exception counts on the radar, and the `tech_standards.approve_exception` permission. Remaining nice-to-haves — daily expiry-notification loop with Risk-Register escalation, positive per-asset conformance assessments, per-standard compliance % tile — are recorded here as backlog, not blocking NORA alignment (NORA requires standards + governed deviations, which exist).

#### (original spec) `superseded`

**NORA ref**: TRM standards, policy management. Blueprint NORA-08 (adopted).

- [ ] Table `standard_waivers` (id, standard_card_id FK, subject_card_id FK, justification, compensating_control, requested_by, approved_by, expires_at, status: requested | approved | rejected | expired) + migration + workspace-io.
- [ ] Conformance stays on the `ITComponent → TechStandard` relation attribute (WP1.3); waiver records hang off it.
- [ ] Expiry: daily background loop (pattern: `_promote_recurring_tasks_loop`) flips overdue waivers to `expired`, notifies the standard owner, and opens a Risk-Register entry (reuse promote pattern).
- [ ] GRC → Compliance gains a **Standards & Waivers** tab: non-compliant assets, expiring waivers, per-standard compliance %.
- [ ] High-mandate (`mandatory`) waivers require committee approval (WP2.2 chain).
- [ ] Permissions (`compliance.manage`), tests, i18n, docs.

**Acceptance**: every deviation from a mandatory standard is either remediated, risk-accepted, or covered by a time-bound waiver that escalates on expiry.

### WP4.4 — Saudi policy packs (NCA ECC / NDMO / PDPL / DGA) `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

> **As implemented**: profile pass 4c seeds four `compliance_regulations` rows — **NCA ECC**, **NDMO Data Management**, **PDPL**, **DGA Digital Government Policy** — whose assessment-scope descriptions key the AI compliance scanner on the NORA profile fields (NDMO classification without owner, secret+ data off-GSB, services without digital channels, apps without BRM/ARM linkage, components on declining standards). Idempotent by key; follows the built-in regulation precedent (labels are proper names, no translations). Findings promote to risks via the existing GRC machinery. **Deferred**: promotion to improvement opportunities (WP3.3 source field ready).

#### (original spec) `superseded`

**NORA ref**: policy management; national alignment. NORA.md item I5.

- [ ] Seeded `compliance_regulations` packs: NCA Essential Cybersecurity Controls, NDMO data-management standards, PDPL, DGA digital-government checks.
- [ ] Scanner rules keyed on Phase-1 fields: e.g. Applications lacking BRM linkage; `secret+` DataObjects exchanged with `viaGsb=false`; GovServices without a digital channel; ITComponents on `declining`/`retired` standards.
- [ ] Findings promote to risks (existing) and to improvement opportunities (WP3.3).
- [ ] Packs are data — update path documented for regulation revisions.
- [ ] Tests (scanner rules), i18n (regulation names/descriptions ar+en), docs.

**Acceptance**: one scan produces a Saudi-compliance findings list with remediation paths into the risk register and transition backlog.

### WP4.5 — Integration & interoperability view `☑ Done 2026-07-02`

> **As implemented**: `GET /reports/interoperability` + **Reports → Interoperability** page — every Interface and DataExchange with integration type, NDMO classification carried, GSB routing, external party, frequency and connected applications (with exchange direction); summary chips and a warning banner for **secret-or-above exchanges running off-GSB** (rows highlighted). This is the WP4.4 scanner's rule made permanently visible. **Delta**: `externalParty` stays free text (picklist promotion deferred until real demand, per plan).

#### (original spec) `superseded`

**NORA ref**: whole-of-government interoperability; AA/DA exchange artifacts. Blueprint NORA-15 (adopted, slimmed).

- [ ] Interoperability report: source app → interface/exchange → target app/external entity, showing protocol, classification, GSB status, standard conformance, SLA — built on existing Interface + WP4.1 DataExchange (no new entities).
- [ ] `externalParty` values promoted to a lightweight picklist managed in settings (external government entities) — avoids a new card type until real demand.
- [ ] Cross-agency exchanges without GSB and without a waiver flagged (feeds WP4.4 scanner).
- [ ] i18n, docs.

**Acceptance**: integration governance can review every external exchange with its standards/classification posture on one screen.

## Phase 5 — NEA Content & Federation *(☑ complete as re-scoped — WP5.1 closed 2026-07-11)*

*Goal: national content, maturity, and DGA-facing outputs.*

### WP5.1 — NEA reference-model catalogue importers `✕ Re-scoped/closed 2026-07-11`

**NORA ref**: Stage 5 — agency models derived from NEA models. NORA.md item A4 + blueprint NORA-04 mapping entities.

> **Re-scope rationale (2026-07-11)** — kit re-review settled what the "reference models" actually are. This WP was designed on the **old NORA assumption** of FEAF-style published taxonomies with authoritative codes (the same assumption behind WP1.1's `brmCode`/`armCode`/`drmCode`/`trmCode` fields). The Dec-2024 framework does not work that way:
>
> 1. **They are forthcoming guidance documents, six of them.** Deck 01 slide 12: the framework comprises **16 documents "targeted for publication in the coming period"**, including one National Reference Model per domain (Business, Beneficiary Experience, Applications, Technology, Security, Data) plus a *guide for developing sectoral reference models*.
> 2. **Their nature is classification guidance, not code lists.** Practice Guideline glossary (p. 93): a reference model "acts as a framework that provides a common vocabulary and a high-level structure… a blueprint… best practices to classify and organize architectural elements." Deck 01 slide 13: agencies "يمكن الاستعانة بها" — *consult* them.
> 3. **The preview slides show category schemes with illustrative samples.** The Business RM defines five capability *categories* (administrative & regulatory / core / supporting / operational / enabling); its health-sector capability tree is explicitly labeled **عينة توضيحية** (illustrative sample). The Applications RM defines application *layers* — already shipped as WP6.2's `appLayer` option set.
>
> **Consequences**: there is no national code list to package as an importable catalogue, and no national denominator for a "coverage %" report — taxonomy content is built per sector/agency, guided by the national models. The original checklist below is closed as based on a superseded assumption. Agency/sector-built taxonomy ingestion is already served by the Capability Catalogue machinery and the WP6.6 حصر البيانات importer; the `*Code` profile fields remain as agency-assigned classification codes.
>
> **Residual follow-up (small, tracked here)**:
> - [ ] When the six National Reference Model documents publish: align the profile's classification option sets (capability categories, application layers, data/technology/security classifications) with the published schemes — an option-set/translation pass on the profile, version-bumped and idempotent per the standing rules; not an importer.
> - [ ] If DGA's *sectoral* reference models later ship as structured content (the sectoral-RM development guide is also forthcoming): revisit packaging those via the Capability-Catalogue wheel pattern — only then does the original importer design apply.

#### (original spec) `superseded — premise invalidated by the Dec-2024 framework`

- [ ] Package the official NEA taxonomies as versioned importable catalogues (Capability-Catalogue wheel pattern; `catalogueId` matching).
- [ ] BRM import → Business Area / LoB skeleton as BusinessCapability tree with `brmLevel`/`brmCode`; auto-relink of existing capabilities by `catalogueId` (macro-capability import is the proven template).
- [ ] ARM/DRM/TRM imports → populate the option sets stubbed in WP1.1 + TechStandard/TechCategory trees; PRM import → KPI reference set.
- [ ] Per-item `alignmentStatus` (aligned | agencyExtension | unmapped) — the blueprint's `NationalReferenceMapping`, folded onto the card `attributes` instead of a join table.
- [ ] Coverage report: % of landscape mapped to national codes, unmapped cards, agency extensions.

> **Partial unblock (2026-07-07, superseded by the 2026-07-11 re-scope)**: the DGA awareness kit delivered the **General Model** (EA Content Meta Model — building blocks, attributes, connections) and the viewpoints catalogue. That content is actioned in **Phase 6** (WP6.2–6.5, 6.7). The "still missing taxonomy content" this note waited for turned out not to exist as importable data — see the re-scope rationale above.

### WP5.2 — EA maturity self-assessment (Qiyas-style) `☑ Done 2026-07-06`

**NORA ref**: Stage 1.3 + Stage 10 maturity assessment. NORA.md item A2.

**As implemented** (self-contained maturity module — **delta**: not built on the Surveys engine, which is card-targeted and a poor fit for scoring abstract dimensions; the assessments table *is* the dated time series, so no separate `kpi_snapshots`-style snapshot table was needed):

- [x] Three tables (migration `133`): `maturity_dimensions` (admin-definable catalogue, seeded with 10 NORA/Qiyas dimensions — governance, the four architecture domains, security & compliance, methodology, performance, change & transition, national alignment), `maturity_assessments` (one dated row per run, weighted 0–100 `overall_score` computed on submit), `maturity_dimension_scores` (per-dimension level + target on a fixed 1–5 CMMI/Qiyas scale, with dimension key/name **snapshotted** so history survives rename/deactivate).
- [x] API `/maturity`: dimension CRUD (built-ins deactivate, customs delete), assessment CRUD (create seeds one score row per active dimension), per-score PATCH, status workflow draft → submitted → approved (approval requires `governance.approve_step`, stamps approver), `GET /maturity/overview` (latest-assessment radar + trend + KPIs), and `POST …/scores/{id}/promote-opportunity` which spawns an Improvement Opportunity (source `maturity`) from a dimension gap — mirroring the compliance-finding → risk promotion. New `maturity.view` / `maturity.manage` permission group; NORA working-team + chief-architect roles granted manage.
- [x] Frontend `/maturity` page (nav-gated to the NORA profile, like `/nora-program`): KPI tiles, Recharts radar (level vs target, RTL-aware) + trend line, assessments table, scoring dialog with per-dimension level/target selects and one-click gap promotion, and a dimension-catalogue manager. Types in `types/index.ts`; i18n ×10 (39 `reports.maturity.*` keys + nav label).
- [x] Workspace-transfer coverage: three `EntitySection`s (dimensions → assessments → scores, dependency-ordered; user FKs on assessments remapped by email). Unit tests (`test_maturity.py` — weighted score, unassessed-row exclusion, seed idempotency) + 14 API integration tests (seed, scoring, submit-computes-overall, governance-gated approval, gap promotion, RBAC 403, radar/trend overview).
- [ ] **Deferred**: DGA Qiyas submission-format export adapter (unblocks if/when DGA publishes the format); per-dimension improvement *actions* as Todos (opportunity promotion covers the WP3.3 feed today); configurable level *labels* (fixed 1–5 CMMI/Qiyas scale with translated labels for now).

**Acceptance check**: an agency can define maturity dimensions, run a dated self-assessment scored 1–5, see the radar + trend, and push gaps into the transition backlog. ✔ verified by tests.

### WP5.3 — NEA alignment / evidence pack export `☑ Done 2026-07-06`

**NORA ref**: NEA federation; auditability. NORA.md item A3 + blueprint NORA-23.

**As implemented**:

- [x] `nea_evidence_packs` table (migration `134`) tracking the generation lifecycle (`generating` → `ready`/`failed`), headline `summary` JSONB, and disk `storage_path`. Binary lives on disk under `data/nea_evidence_packs/{id}.xlsx` — same pattern as `workspace_transfers`; Postgres stays lean.
- [x] Aggregation + workbook builder (`services/nea_evidence.py`, openpyxl — the workspace-io xlsx dep): seven sheets — **Overview** (headline metrics), **EA Maturity** (latest assessment level vs target), **Program Status** (deliverables by stage), **BRM Coverage** (capabilities + coverage %), **Shared Services** (GovService/Application shared flags), **Standards Compliance** (standards + mandate + open exceptions), **Approval History** (recent governance events). Every sheet builder is individually guarded (`_safe` roll-back pattern) so an empty/immature landscape still produces a valid pack.
- [x] API `/nea-evidence-packs`: `POST` (generate, synchronous read-only aggregation; `nora.manage`), `GET` (list with generator names), `GET /{id}`, `GET /{id}/download` (streams the xlsx; `nora.view`), `DELETE` (removes row + file; `nora.manage`). **Immutable** — no update endpoint.
- [x] Frontend: **NEA Evidence Packs** panel embedded on the NORA Program page (`NeaEvidencePanel.tsx`) — generate button, list with maturity/BRM/program % highlight chips, download + delete. i18n ×10 (13 `noraProgram.evidence.*` nav keys).
- [x] Tests (`test_nea_evidence.py`): generate → ready with correct BRM coverage %, xlsx magic-byte download, list, delete; empty-landscape generation stays `ready` (graceful degradation); `nora.view`-only member can list but not generate (403).
- [x] **Workspace-transfer decision**: evidence packs are *deliberately excluded* from the bundle (`ENTITY_SECTIONS`) — they are regenerable, immutable outputs with on-disk binaries, exactly like `workspace_transfers`, which are also excluded. Regenerate on the target instance instead of transferring.
- [ ] **Deferred**: zip wrapper (single xlsx is the deliverable today; a zip with embedded diagrams/attachments can wrap it later); scheduled/periodic auto-generation; `.xlsx` cell styling beyond bold headers + autosize.

**Acceptance check**: an agency can produce a dated, immutable NEA alignment package covering BRM coverage, shared services, standards, maturity, program status and approval history, and download it for federation/audit. ✔ verified by tests.

### WP5.4 — Plateaus / time-slice views + segment scopes `☑ Done 2026-07-07`

**NORA ref**: 3–5y blueprint sequencing; NEA segment architecture. NORA.md items A1/A5 + blueprint ArchitectureScope (slimmed to a filter-set entity).

**As implemented** (two small overlays on the single canonical landscape — never a copy):

- [x] `nora_plateaus` + `nora_segments` tables (migration `135`). **Plateau** = named target date; `GET /nora-plateaus/{id}/landscape` reclassifies every non-archived card's lifecycle phase *as of* that date (`phase_as_of` mirrors `reports._current_lifecycle_phase` but parameterised by the plateau date) and breaks the landscape down by phase + `architecture_state`. **Segment** = card-rooted scope (`root_card_id`) resolved to root + hierarchy descendants (BFS down `parent_id`) + one-hop related cards, optionally narrowed to `related_type_keys`, grouped into the four EA layers.
- [x] API `/nora-plateaus` + `/nora-segments`: full CRUD + `GET /nora-segments/{id}/cards` (resolved, layer-grouped) + `GET /nora-plateaus/{id}/landscape` (time-slice). `nora.view` to read, `nora.manage` to mutate.
- [x] Frontend: **Plateaus & Segments** panel on the NORA Program page (`PlateausSegmentsPanel.tsx`) — segment CRUD (root `CardPicker`, descendants/related switches, related-type narrowing via `useMetamodel`) with a layer-grouped **scope viewer** (clickable card chips coloured by `LAYER_COLORS`); plateau CRUD with a **time-slice viewer** (phase + architecture-state chips). i18n ×10 (31 `noraProgram.landscape.*` nav keys).
- [x] Workspace-transfer coverage: `NoraPlateaus` + `NoraSegments` EntitySections (segment `root_card_id` remapped as a card FK). Tests: `test_nora_landscape.py` — pure `phase_as_of`, hierarchy+related resolution, related-type narrowing, plateau as-of phase classification, RBAC 403.
- [x] **Segment filtering — Inventory & Reports (B.9 Frontend)** `2026-07-13`: segment scope as a live filter in inventory and dependency/landscape reports. **Implementation**:
  - Backend: ✔ `/cards?segment_id=` + `/reports/*?segment_id=` (7 endpoints support it via shared `_get_segment_scope()` helper, backend completed 2026-07-13)
  - Frontend: 
    - ✔ `useSegments` hook (singleton cache pattern paralleling `useMetamodel`)
    - ✔ **Inventory segment filter** in `InventoryFilterSideBar` (chips, multi-select, sorted by `sort_order`, coloured by segment `.color`)
    - ✔ `GET /cards?segment_id=first-only` parameter wiring in `InventoryPage` 
    - ✔ **DependencyReport segment chips** (in filter bar after plateaus, replicates plateau pattern)
    - ✔ i18n: `filter.segments` key in all 10 locales (en="Scopes", de="Geltungsbereiche", fr="Portées", es="Alcances", it="Ambiti", pt="Escopos", ru="Области видимости", da="Omfang", ar="النطاقات", zh="范围")
  - **Pattern for remaining reports** (PortfolioReport, CapabilityMapReport, MatrixReport, CostReport, TechLandscapeReport, FlexiblePortfolioReport): import `useSegments`, add `selectedSegmentId` state, pass `segment_id` param to API call, add chips/dropdown UI, add to useEffect dependency array (copy-paste from DependencyReport works, ~40 lines per report).
  - Tests: backend `test_segment_filtering.py` covers invalid UUIDs / non-existent / empty segments / wildcard resolution ✔.
- [ ] **Deferred** (lower priority, P2): `TimelineSlider` component for scrubbing plateaus directly on reports (the per-plateau landscape breakdown covers the analytical need today); seeded default plateaus; segment filtering on the remaining reports (PortfolioReport, CapabilityMapReport, MatrixReport, CostReport, TechLandscapeReport).

**Acceptance check**: an agency can name plateaus and see the landscape's phase distribution at each, and define reusable capability-rooted segments and view their in-scope cards by layer. ✔ verified by tests.

### WP5.5 — AI-assisted NORA authoring `☑ Done 2026-07-07`

**NORA ref**: productivity on Stages 6.6/7. NORA.md item A6.

**As implemented**:

- [x] `services/nora_authoring.py` — gathers compact landscape signals (capabilities with no linked cards, applications with data quality <50%, target/transition cards with no delivering initiative, landscape composition), builds a NORA-advisor prompt, and calls the shared TurboLens AI plumbing (`call_ai` / `parse_json` / `is_ai_configured` — Claude / OpenAI / DeepSeek / Gemini / Ollama). Output language switches to **Arabic** when `locale=ar`. Returns cleaned, clamped suggestions (`{title, description, domain, priority, source:"ai"}`), capped at 8 — **never persisted here**.
- [x] `POST /improvement-opportunities/ai-suggest` (gated `grc.manage` + `ai.suggest`) returns the drafts; a clear 400 when AI is not configured. Accepted drafts are committed via the existing `POST /improvement-opportunities` with `source="ai"`, landing as **`proposed`** — governance approval stays a human step. Added `ai` to `OPPORTUNITY_SOURCES`.
- [x] Frontend: **AI suggest** button on the Opportunities panel (shown when the user holds `ai.suggest`) opens a dialog — language (en/ar) + optional focus, **Generate**, then a checkbox review list of drafts with domain/priority chips, and **Add selected** which creates the chosen ones as proposed. i18n ×10 (8 `governance.opportunities.ai*` keys).
- [x] Tests (`test_nora_authoring.py`): `_clean` clamping/tagging (pure), endpoint suggest→commit-as-proposed with the LLM mocked, not-configured → 400, viewer-without-`grc.manage` → 403.
- [ ] **Deferred**: AI-drafted *target directions* on individual cards (the opportunity registry is the higher-value, lower-risk surface; card-level target authoring can reuse this plumbing later); background/streaming generation (the synchronous call is fast enough for ≤8 suggestions).

**Acceptance check**: an architect can ask the AI for NORA improvement opportunities (in Arabic or English), review the drafts, and land the accepted ones as proposed records that still require human governance. ✔ verified by tests.

## Source review — DGA awareness kit (2026-07-07)

Full review of `الحقيبة التوعوية - البنية المؤسسية الوطنية` (repo root). Contents and what each part changes:

| Kit item | What it is | Impact on this plan |
|---|---|---|
| `الحقيبة التدريبية - المنهجية المحدثة` (5 decks, ~500 slides, Arabic) | Training on the **updated National Methodology** for developing EA components | **The methodology changed.** It is now **7 phases + 4 supporting elements + 6 domains**, not the 10 stages our `/nora-program` tracker seeds. Old stages 4–5 (framework + reference models) were re-designed into separate framework documents (General Model, Viewpoints, national reference models). → WP6.1 |
| `The "EA Content Meta Model" Document` (Dec 2024, v1.0, 132 pp, English) | The **General Model (النموذج العام)**: definitions, attributes and connections of all **37 building blocks** across Strategic Alignment + 6 domains | This *is* the missing "NEA general model" WP5.1 waited for (attribute level, not taxonomy codes).

**Updated methodology (7 phases + continuous element)** — the target for WP6.1:

| # | Phase (ar) | Steps |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | تحديد نطاق عمل دورة تطوير البنية المؤسسية (Define development-cycle scope) | 1.1 Study & assess EA development requirements · 1.2 Frame the cycle scope · 1.3 Approve requirements + scope |
| 2 | تشخيص الوضع الراهن (Current-state diagnosis) — *executed per domain ×6* | 2.1 Define the domain's approved scope · 2.2 **Data collection (حصر البيانات — the xlsx templates)** · 2.3 Document current building blocks + viewpoints · 2.4 Analyze & recommend |
| 3 | دراسة التوجهات المستقبلية (Study future trends) | 3.1 Review current-state results · 3.2 Study comparable practices · 3.3 Set future design directions |
| 4 | تصميم الوضع المستقبلي (Target-state design) — *per domain* | 4.1 Initial target concept · 4.2 Detail target building blocks + viewpoints |
| 5 | تحليل فجوات البنية المؤسسية (Gap analysis) | 5.1 Analyze & identify gaps · 5.2 Propose & approve gap solutions |
| 6 | تطوير خارطة الطريق (Roadmap development) | 6.1 Propose & approve EA initiative list · 6.2 Prepare the EA roadmap |
| 7 | إدارة متطلبات البنية المؤسسية (EA requirements management — **continuous**) | 7.1 Approve EA requirements · 7.2 Track requirement status · 7.3 Assess requirement-change impact |

Supporting elements: EA principles (✓ `ea_principles`), national reference models (✓ resolved 2026-07-11 — classification guidance, not taxonomy data; see the WP5.1 re-scope), the General Model (now in hand), EA governance (✓ WP2.2/2.3).

**The 37 building blocks → Turbo EA mapping** (basis for WP6.2–6.5; ✓ = covered today, ◐ = partial, ✕ = missing):

- **Strategic Alignment**: Vision ✕ · Mission ✕ · Objective ✓ · Pillar ✕ · Initiative ✓ · Project ✓ (Initiative subtype) · KPI ✓ (WP4.2)
- **Business**: Business Capability ✓ · Organizational Unit ✓ (Organization) · Service Provider ✓ (Provider) · Service ◐ (GovService — field gaps vs template, see WP6.2) · Processes Group ◐ (BusinessProcess hierarchy) · Business Process ◐ (field gaps) · Product ✓ (BusinessContext subtype) · Position ✕ · Role ✕ · **Policy ✕** · **Model/Template (Form) ✕**
- **Beneficiary Experience**: Beneficiary ✕ · Beneficiary Journey ◐ (BusinessContext `customerJourney` subtype, no structure) · **Persona ✕** · Journey Phase ✕ · Journey Step ✕
- **Data**: Data Entity ✓ (DataObject) · **Data Vault ✕** · Data Attributes ✕ (attribute-level registry with stewards/CRUD — see WP6.2 scoping note)
- **Applications**: Application ◐ (register-field gaps) · Application Module ◐ (Application hierarchy) · Application Function ✕ · Technical Integration Interface ◐ (Interface/DataExchange — field gaps)
- **Technology**: Data Center ✕ · Physical Host ✕ · Server ✕ · Network Device ✕ · Network Link ✕ · Storage ✕ · Containerization Engine ✕ · Infrastructure Management Tool ✕ · License ✕ · Infrastructure Service ✕ · Peripheral Device ✕ — all currently blurred into generic ITComponent subtypes (Software/Hardware/Service)
- **Security**: Security Hardware ✕ · Security Software ✕ · Security Service ✕ (the fork's "Security Layer overview" report aggregates GRC posture; the *domain building blocks* don't exist)

---

## Phase 6 — Updated-Framework Alignment (Dec-2024 NEA)

*Goal: Turbo EA speaks the **updated** National EA Framework natively — 7-phase methodology, 6 domains, the General Model's building blocks, the core viewpoints, and one-click ingestion of DGA's own data-collection templates. Same guiding rule as ever: profile + overlay + views on the one canonical landscape; prefer subtypes/fields over new card types, new card types over parallel modules.*

### WP6.1 — Methodology v2: 7-phase program tracker `☑ Done 2026-07-11`

**NORA ref**: المنهجية الوطنية المحدثة (7 phases, per-domain execution of phases 2 & 4).

**As implemented** (design deltas noted inline):

- [x] `noraMethodologyVersion` (`v1` = 10-stage, `v2` = 7-phase) stored in `general_settings`. Fresh NORA applies resolve to **v2**; installs that already carry deliverable rows resolve to **v1** — a live program is never silently rewritten. `POST /nora-program/methodology` (admin.settings) switches either way; the other catalogue's rows are **retained** as history. **Delta**: both catalogues share the one `ea_program_deliverables` table exactly as planned — membership derives from the key prefix (`p{1-7}_…` / `custom_v2_…` vs `s*_`/`cg_`/`custom_`), zero schema change.
- [x] v2 catalogue (44 deliverables): phase 1 ×3 steps, phase 2 **×6 domains ×4 steps** (scope / حصر البيانات data collection / documentation / analysis), phase 3 ×3, phase 4 = one cycle-level target concept + per-domain detail ×6, phases 5/6 ×2 each, phase 7 (continuous requirements management) ×3. Domain parsed from the key and returned per deliverable for the UI chips.
- [x] `/nora-program` UI: v2 phase names + per-domain chips (i18n ×10), methodology chip in the header, and the v1→v2 **switch dialog** (admin.settings-gated, explains the new catalogue + history retention).
- [x] **EA Requirements register**: `ea_requirements` + `ea_requirement_cards` (migration `139`), `/ea-requirements` CRUD under `nora.view`/`nora.manage`, approval gated on `governance.approve_step` (stamps approver + time), initiative link auto-advances approved → `inCycle`, change-impact via dependency-report deep-link on linked cards. Requirements panel on `/nora-program` (create/edit dialog, card links via `CardPicker`, initiative assignment). Workspace-io sections (initiative + card FKs remapped, users by email). i18n ×10.
- [x] Evidence suggestions: phase-2 data-collection rows suggest the WP6.6 importer; phase-5/6 rows deep-link the Gap Analysis report and roadmap (client-side chips shown until real evidence lands).
- [x] Tests: methodology switch + filtering + custom-deliverable scoping + v2 idempotency (`test_nora_program.py::TestMethodologyV2`), full requirements lifecycle + RBAC (`test_ea_requirements.py`). NORA demo dataset moved to v2 keys (`seed_demo_nora.py`).

**Acceptance check**: a fresh NORA install shows the 7-phase program with per-domain phase-2/4 tracking; an existing v1 install is untouched until opted in; EA requirements are registered, approved, tracked, and change-impact-assessed. ✔ verified by tests.

### WP6.2 — Metamodel alignment to the EA Content Meta Model (profile v2 fields) `☑ Done 2026-07-07`

**NORA ref**: EA Content Meta Model §5.3 + the six حصر البيانات templates (column-exact).

**As implemented** (`NORA_V2_TYPE_FIELDS` + `NORA_V2_SUBTYPES` in `nora_profile.py`, merged into the canonical `NORA_TYPE_FIELDS`; `NORA_PROFILE_VERSION` 1 → 2 so existing NORA installs upgrade idempotently at startup; all fields weight-0, translated ×9, option sets verbatim from the templates' Lookup sheets):

- [x] **GovService** (+9): `serviceClassification` (main | sub), `serviceType` (administrative | core | supporting), `automationLevel` (same option set as Application's), `geoCoverage`, `serviceRequirements`, `serviceInputs`/`serviceOutputs`, `participatingEntities`, `executionSteps`. **`has_hierarchy` enabled** (fresh installs via the type def; existing built-in GovService rows upgraded by pass 4d — admin-created types keyed GovService are never touched). Sub-services attach to their main service via `parent_id`.
- [x] **BusinessProcess** (+6): `processClassification` (main | sub), `triggerEvent`, `businessRules`, `durationDays`, `processInputs`/`processOutputs`. (`automationLevel` already exists in the seed — verified, not duplicated.)
- [x] **Application** (+9): `appLayer` (access | core | support | data | infrastructure), `developmentType` (cots | bespoke), `sourceType` (inHouse | outsourced | managedByThirdParty), `contractor`, `appUrl`, `authenticationMethod`, `launchDate`, `architecturePattern` (nTier | clientServer | microservices | eventDriven), `costCapex`. **Deltas (mapped, not duplicated)**: criticality → seed `businessCriticality`; user count → seed `numberOfUsers`; operating cost → seed `costTotalAnnual`; `applicationStatus` → existing lifecycle phases — the WP6.6 importer maps these columns.
- [x] **Interface** (+5): `integrationScope` (internal | external), `integrationPlatform`, `linkType` (direct | integrationPlatform | gsb | gsn), `interfaceInputs`/`interfaceOutputs`. **Deltas**: طريقة الربط → seed free-text `protocol`; صيغة البيانات → seed free-text `dataFormat`; DataExchange untouched (its exchangeMethod/frequency/viaGsb already cover exchange semantics — the template's integration-point rows land on Interface).
- [x] **ITComponent** (+9): `supportEndDate`, `supportContractStatus` (active | expired), `operationType` (internalTeam | serviceProvider | hybrid), `initialCost`, `environment` (production | test | staging | disasterRecovery), `clusterId`, `firmwareVersion`, `inBackupPolicy`/`inDrPolicy`. **Deltas**: network segment → WP1.1's free-text `securityZone`; annual operating cost → seed `costTotalAnnual`.
- [x] **DataObject** (+1): `dataType`. Ar/En names ride card name/description conventions. **Data-attributes registry descoped as cards** (attribute rows are catalogue data, not landscape entities) — final vehicle decided in WP6.6 (imported xlsx lands as card attachment by default).
- [x] **Subtypes** (new pass 4d, idempotent by key): `Objective.pillar` (strategy decomposition), `ITComponent.dataVault` (مستودع بيانات; the `DataObject → ITComponent` "is stored in" relation exists since WP4.1). GovService hierarchy upgrade shares the pass, guarded to `built_in=True` rows only.
- [x] Tests: v2 definition tests (field presence per template, appLayer lookup-order check, subtype translations ×9, no seed collisions, profile version) + 3 DB tests (v1→v2 hierarchy upgrade + summary flag, admin-created GovService untouched, v2 fields injected into both seed and NORA-created types). `test_seed_demo_nora.py` helper fixed (NORA card types registered before the field merge; v2 subtypes included). Stale WP4.2-era assertions in `test_nora_profile.py` corrected (relation-set superset; GovService-preserved no longer asserts an empty created list). All NORA + governance backend suites green against the DB harness.
- [x] Workspace-io: nothing needed — new fields ride `cards.attributes` (JSONB, already in `CARD_COLUMNS`); subtypes/fields_schema live on `card_types`, which the metamodel section already covers.
- [x] Vision/Mission settings fields — **done 2026-07-11 with WP6.7's Strategic House**: `general_settings.noraVision`/`noraMission` + `GET/PATCH /settings/strategy-house`, edited in-place on the Strategic House page (admin.settings).

**Drive-by fixes surfaced by this WP's test run** (all pre-existing, fixed + changelogged in CHANGELOG.fork.md):
1. `users.role` was `String(20)` — assigning the seeded 23-char `ea_governance_committee` role key to any user failed with a DB truncation error (WP2.3 defect). Widened to `String(50)` (matches `roles.key`); migration `136_widen_users_role_fork.py`.
2. The three NORA report routes (gap-analysis, service-traceability, interoperability) checked the **non-existent** permission key `reports.view` → 403 for every non-admin. Now `reports.ea_dashboard` per fork convention.
3. `GET /cards` count-query bug: the approval-status count filter sat in the *architecture-state* branch (UnboundLocalError → 500 when filtering by state alone) and was missing from the approval-status branch (wrong pagination totals). Both fixed.

**Acceptance**: every column of the six templates has a landing field or a documented mapping; option sets match the Lookup sheets; re-apply is a no-op; v1 installs upgrade in place. ✔ verified by tests.

### WP6.3 — Technology Architecture granularity (TA building blocks) `☑ Done 2026-07-11` *(subtypes + manufacturer/model/function fields shipped 2026-07-08 via profile v2; spec-section fields shipped 2026-07-11 via profile v4 — networkSegment, serverRole, CPU/RAM/storage, OS/hypervisor, DC role/tier, license quantity/dates in a "Technical Specification" section; **Technology Landscape report shipped 2026-07-11**: `GET /reports/technology-landscape` + `/reports/technology-landscape` page — data-center containment landscape (DC ⊃ host ⊃ VM ⊃ container engine from the ITComponent hierarchy, depth-indented, unassigned bucket) + network-segment distribution (falls back to `securityZone`) + summary tiles + WP6.4's security-only toggle; i18n ×10; API tests in `test_technology_landscape.py`)*

**NORA ref**: Meta Model §5.3.6 (11 TA building blocks); بنية التقنية template (6 sheets).

The NEA wants Data Center / Physical Host / Server / Network Device / Storage / Infra Tool / Infra Service / License / Containerization Engine / Network Link / Peripheral as distinguishable inventory. Turbo EA's answer is **subtypes, not card types**:

- [ ] Extend ITComponent subtypes (profile apply, idempotent, translated): `dataCenter`, `physicalHost`, `virtualServer`, `networkDevice`, `storage`, `infraTool`, `infraService`, `securityHardware`, `securitySoftware`, `securityService` (WP6.4), `dataVault` (WP6.2), `license`, `containerEngine`, `peripheral`. Existing Software/Hardware/SaaS/PaaS/IaaS/Service/AI Model subtypes stay — the NEA set is additive.
- [ ] Per-subtype relevance: the shared WP6.2 fields cover ~90% of the template columns; genuinely subtype-specific ones (vCPU/RAM/disk, hypervisor, storage capacity, network device function) land in a single "Technical Specification" section with `weight: 0` fields — visible on all ITComponents, filled where relevant. **Do not** build per-subtype field schemas (the metamodel doesn't support subtype-scoped fields; keep it flat and optional).
- [ ] Hosting chains (VM → physical host → data center): **verified 2026-07-07** — the `(ITComponent, ITComponent)` pair is already taken by the seeded `relITCSuccessor` ("succeeds"), so a second "runs on / hosts" relation type is forbidden by the one-pair rule. Use the **existing ITComponent hierarchy** (`has_hierarchy=True`, `parent_id`) for containment chains instead: DC ⊃ host ⊃ VM ⊃ container engine — which also makes the Datacenter landscape a free hierarchy render. Where succession *and* hosting must coexist on the same pair in non-hierarchical form, add a `relationRole` attribute to `relITCSuccessor` only as a last resort (prefer hierarchy). `Network Link` is descoped as a card type — it's an edge; relation attributes cover it.
- [ ] Reports: **Datacenter distribution landscape** + **Servers/Network/Storage catalogues** = inventory filtered by subtype (free) + one dedicated "Technology Landscape" report page grouping ITComponents by `dataCenter` hierarchy and `networkSegment` (the two viewpoints the inventory can't render).

**Acceptance**: the six Technology-template sheets each have a subtype home; hosting chains (VM → host → DC) are modellable; the physical-level TA catalogues are producible as filtered inventory + the landscape report.

### WP6.4 — Security Architecture domain `☑ Done 2026-07-11` *(subtypes shipped 2026-07-08 via profile v2; the remainder shipped 2026-07-11 as **profile v5**: (a) `usageRole` attribute (uses | protects) injected on `relAppToITC` — pass 3c, idempotent, translated ×9 — protection semantics without breaking the one-pair rule; (b) security views — the Technology Landscape report's security-only toggle + a "Security components" section on the Security layer overview listing the three security subtypes with a jump to the landscape; (c) the NCA ECC scanner scope extended to flag applications with no linked security component — guarded description upgrade, admin-edited text never overwritten; (d) per-domain tracker content: the WP6.1 v2 catalogue carries Security-domain phase-2/4 deliverables. `securityFunction` delta: the profile-v2 `deviceFunction` field already covers the template's function column — mapped, not duplicated.)*

**NORA ref**: Meta Model §5.3.7 (Security Hardware / Software / Service); بنية الأمن template (3 sheets); security viewpoints.

- [ ] Subtypes `securityHardware` / `securitySoftware` / `securityService` on ITComponent (see WP6.3) + security-specific fields: `securityFunction` (free text per template — firewall/WAF/IPS/SOC/SIEM…), reusing WP6.2's shared support/cost/segment fields for everything else. The template's columns are ~identical to the TA sheets plus function.
- [ ] Relations: `Application → ITComponent` "is protected by / protects" **only if** the pair isn't already taken (it is — "uses"); per the one-pair rule, model protection as a `usageRole` attribute (`protects` option) on the existing relation type instead.
- [ ] **Security domain views**: Security Hardware/Software/Services catalogues = filtered inventory (free); "Security Architecture Capabilities landscape" + "Security hardware by data center" fold into the WP6.3 Technology Landscape report with a security toggle; the existing Security Layer overview report (GRC posture) gains a "Security components" section reading the new subtypes.
- [ ] Program tracker: phase-2/4 Security-domain deliverables (WP6.1) now have real landing content; the WP4.4 NCA ECC scanner rules extend to flag apps with no linked security component in scope.

**Acceptance**: the Security-architecture template's three sheets are capturable and reportable; the security domain shows up as a first-class column in per-domain program tracking.

### WP6.5 — Beneficiary Experience domain `☑ Done 2026-07-11` *(profile v4 shipped the **Persona card type** (code/objectives/demographics/pain points + uses→GovService, experiences→BeneficiaryJourney relations, Beneficiary Experience layer per the WP6.9 note) and **journey structure** as `journeyPhase`/`journeyStep` subtypes on the hierarchical BeneficiaryJourney type + a "Journey Mapping" section + covers→GovService and uses-channel→Channel relations — superseding the `journeyPhases`-JSONB/custom-section idea below, zero custom UI. **2026-07-11 remainder shipped**: `journey_card_id` / `journey_phase` / `feasibility` columns on `improvement_opportunities` (migration `140`), **BX + SEC** joined the domain options (six-domain model), Opportunities panel gained the journey `CardPicker` + phase + feasibility fields and chips, journey FK remapped in the workspace bundle, API validation + tests. Persona Card / Journey Map viewpoints resolve to the Persona card detail and the BeneficiaryJourney hierarchy in the WP6.7 registry — no dedicated renderers needed.)*

**NORA ref**: Meta Model §5.3.3 (Beneficiary, Journey, Persona, Phase, Step); بنية التجربة template; BX viewpoints (Persona Card, Journey Map, journey-improvement matrix).

- [ ] **Persona** card type (new, Business Architecture layer, profile-delivered like GovService): needs/goals/pain-points/channel-preference fields per Meta Model §5.3.3.2.3. Relations (pair-safe): `Persona → GovService` (uses / is used by), `Persona → BusinessContext` (experiences / is experienced by, scoped to journeys in UI).
- [ ] **Beneficiary Journey structure**: journeys stay `BusinessContext` subtype `customerJourney` (never a parallel type). Phases/steps are journey-internal structure, not landscape entities → model as an ordered `journeyPhases` JSONB field (phase name + steps + channel + emotion/pain-point) rendered by a small **Journey Map section** on the card detail (custom section component — the one justified piece of custom UI in this WP).
- [ ] **Journey improvements** — the template row is (journey, phase, gap, opportunity, impact, feasibility, priority): extend `improvement_opportunities` with nullable `journey_card_id` + `journey_phase` + `feasibility` (high | medium | low) columns (migration; the `domain` enum already carries BX? — it carries BA/AA/DA/TA: **add `bx` and `sec`** to the domain options while at it, matching the 6-domain model). The template then imports straight into the registry (WP6.6).
- [ ] `Beneficiary` building block: descoped as a card type — beneficiary *types* are already `beneficiaryType` options on GovService and Persona covers the analytical need; a beneficiary registry of actual people/segments is CRM territory, not EA. Documented descope.
- [ ] Viewpoints: Persona Card (card detail is the card), Journey Map (the new section), Services/Personas + Journeys/Improvement-priorities matrices = Matrix report + Opportunities registry filters.

**Acceptance**: personas and structured journeys are modellable, journey improvements land in the opportunity registry with journey/phase traceability, and the BX domain participates in per-domain program tracking.

### WP6.6 — DGA data-collection template importer (حصر البيانات) `☑ Done 2026-07-08` *(importer; template exporter deferred)*

**NORA ref**: Methodology phase 2.2 for every domain; the six official xlsx templates.

**As implemented** (`backend/app/services/migration/sources/nora_xlsx/` — adapter `nora_xlsx`, registered in the migration source registry; zero pipeline/route/UI changes, exactly as the adapter pattern promises):

- [x] **Parser** (`xlsx_parser.py`): one parser handles any of the six workbooks. Sheets recognised by normalized Arabic-token containment (hamza/teh-marbuta/diacritics/whitespace folding — resilient to template revisions); layout row 1 title / row 2 headers / row 3 explanations / rows 4+ data; merged group headers (the beneficiary-type yes/no triple) resolve via the explanation row. Value coercion: Lookup-label → option-key matching (longest-token, bilingual — handles "COTS – كود مصدري جاهز"), numbers-with-units ("7500 مرة", "10 أيام عمل"), dd-mm-yyyy dates, costs with thousands separators, نعم/لا booleans.
- [x] **Sheet → type routing**: دليل الخدمات → GovService (incl. main/sub hierarchy via الخدمة الأساسية) · دليل الإجراءات → BusinessProcess · سجل التطبيقات → Application · نقاط الربط التقني → Interface (GSB link type also sets `viaGsb`) · قاموس البيانات → DataObject (NDMO classification) · six بنية التقنية sheets + three بنية الأمن sheets → ITComponent with the matching NEA subtype. Application status column → **lifecycle** (the WP6.2 mapping); criticality → `businessCriticality`; طريقة الربط/صيغة البيانات → seed `protocol`/`dataFormat`.
- [x] **Identity & relations**: source ids synthesized from normalized names (`nora:<Type>:<name>`) so name references resolve in-file, across workbooks (identity map), and against pre-existing TEA cards (staging's name+type fallback). Relation columns (services → applications, procedures → services + applications, integration points → consumer/producer applications) emit snapshot relations onto `relGovServiceToApp` / `relGovServiceToProcess` / `relProcessToApp` / `relAppToInterface`. Referenced names without a row become **stub entities** — they bind to same-name existing cards (verified: never blanking their description, via the `post_build_card_payload` hook) or land as minimal placeholder cards tagged `source_origin: nora_xlsx:referenced` so inventory gaps stay visible.
- [x] **Prerequisite subtypes pulled forward** (WP6.3/6.4 metamodel halves, folded into profile v2 since it hadn't shipped): 13 NEA subtypes on ITComponent (dataCenter, physicalHost, virtualServer, networkDevice, storage, infraTool, infraService, license, containerEngine, peripheral, securityHardware, securitySoftware, securityService) + `manufacturer`/`modelNumber`/`deviceFunction` text fields, all ×10 locales.
- [x] **Tests**: 8 parser unit tests (synthetic workbooks per domain — business incl. beneficiary-triple + multi-channel + stubs, applications incl. GSB integration point + lifecycle, technology + security subtype routing, data dictionary, experience-workbook descope, registry contract, stub-payload safety) + 2 end-to-end DB tests (stage → apply: hierarchy, stub-binds-to-existing-card without wiping description, relation endpoints, idempotent re-run; tech-sheet subtype routing).
- [x] **UI/i18n/docs**: source appears automatically in the Migration admin picker (registry-driven, label used verbatim); `docs/admin/migration.md` supported-sources table + NORA guidance section added in **all 10 locales**.
- [ ] **Deferred — template exporter** ("Export NORA template" per domain, openpyxl writing the official column layout from live cards, buttons on the NORA program phase-2 rows): the submission-roundtrip half; build on the WP5.3 evidence-pack machinery when DGA submission is actually requested.
- [ ] **Deferred — non-card sheets** (documented in the docs): journey improvements → `improvement_opportunities` (needs a per-source post-apply hook; pairs naturally with WP6.5's journey fields), forms/policies (→ WP6.8 Policy card-type decision), stakeholders (names without emails aren't importable as subscriptions), data attribute-level registries (→ WP6.6 attachment decision recorded in WP6.2).

**Acceptance**: an agency uploads its filled بنية الأعمال/التطبيقات/التقنية/الأمن/البيانات workbooks in any order, previews staged records, applies, and every card-bearing sheet lands on the right types/subtypes/fields with relations and hierarchy; re-import is a no-op. ✔ verified by unit + DB tests. *(Reverse export deferred as noted.)*

#### (original spec) `superseded`

- Agencies executing the national methodology fill *these exact files*. Turbo EA should swallow them whole: NORA template adapter under the migration framework; named-relation columns resolving by card name with staged warnings; non-card rows via a post-apply hook or follow-up; import + export roundtrip; automatic source picker; resilient Arabic header matching with synthetic-workbook tests.

### WP6.7 — Viewpoint library alignment (~47 core viewpoints) `☑ Done 2026-07-11`

**NORA ref**: EA Viewpoints Document §5.4 list + §06 detail cards.

- [x] **Coverage map / viewpoint registry shipped 2026-07-11**: the authoritative §5.4 table was extracted from the kit's Viewpoints PDF (all **47** core viewpoints) into `frontend/src/features/reports/neaViewpoints.ts` — a data-driven registry with bilingual (ar/en, from the document) names, kind (list/matrix/diagram), level (conceptual/logical/physical), status, and the deep-link to the Turbo EA view that produces each. Rendered as a **"NEA viewpoint registry"** section in the View Library (`EaViewLibraryPage`): per-domain accordions (7 domains), status chips (open view / closest view / descoped), and locale-aware primary/secondary name display. i18n chrome ×10. Status split: **~37 available** (deep-linked), **5 "planned"** mapped to their closest existing view, **~7 "descoped"** (viewpoints resting on the deliberately-descoped Position/Role, Beneficiary registry, Template, Data-Attributes and Network-Link building blocks — descope decisions from WP6.2/6.5/6.8, now visible instead of silent).
- [x] Methodology linkage (phases 2.3 / 4.2) stated on every registry row.
- [x] **New renderers shipped (2026-07-11, second pass)**: **Strategic House** (`/reports/strategic-house` — vision/mission settings + `GET/PATCH /settings/strategy-house` closing WP6.2's deferred fields; pillar columns via the newly-enabled Objective hierarchy, profile v5), **Business Value Chain** (`/reports/value-chain` — chevron ribbon of top-tier capabilities, strategic/supporting bands from `capabilityType`), **Application Modules landscape** (`/reports/application-modules` — hierarchy tree). Registry rows flipped to available; i18n ×10; strategy-house settings covered by API tests.
- [x] **Interaction Model** and **Applications by Org Unit** stay mapped to the Dependencies and Matrix reports — the acceptance's "rest mapped to existing machinery" case (both are matrix/graph-producible today; dedicated presets only if agencies ask).

**Acceptance check**: the View Library answers "which NEA viewpoint is this and where do I produce it" for all ~47, with 3 genuinely new renderers built (+ WP6.3's landscape) and the rest mapped to existing machinery. ✔

### WP6.8 — Practice operating-model pack `☑ Done 2026-07-11`

**NORA ref**: Establishing EA Practice Guideline §4.1–4.10 (10 artifacts → one "Operating Model" deliverable).

**As implemented**:

- [x] **Nine new governed-document templates** on the `doc_type`/`soawTemplate.ts` machinery: **EA Mandates**, **EA Services**, **EA Organizational Structure**, **EA Governance Model**, **EA Processes**, **EA Interaction Model**, **EA KPIs** (documented framework; measured values stay KPI cards), **EA Vocabulary** and the umbrella **EA Operating Model** (10 sections mirroring the guideline's artifact set). Backend `doc_type` pattern widened; all templates reachable from the program page's "New NORA document" menu (practice group below a divider). Revision chain / sign-off / DOCX+PDF export inherited for free (WP3.2 machinery). Doc labels + 40 section titles + menu labels translated ×10.
- [x] **EA Vocabulary (§4.9)** delivered as the `ea_vocabulary` governed-document template (scope & conventions + terms & definitions) — governed, signable, exportable. **Delta**: the additional `docs/`-reference glossary page rides the standing fork docs pass (deferred with it).
- [x] **Policy card type** — shipped earlier via profile v4 (Business layer, *governs* relations); **Model/Template (Form)** stays a documented descope (Document links at import time).
- [x] **Practice-establishment checklist** on `/nora-program`: the guideline's 10 artifacts seeded as status-tracked deliverable rows under sentinel stage −1 (`practice_*` keys, `seed_practice_checklist`, idempotent, profile pass 5). Rendered as its own accordion under **both** methodologies, excluded from the methodology summary/progress, with one-click **Create document** chips linking each row to its matching template. Evidence links + stage-gate approval work exactly like methodology deliverables. Tests: seeding idempotency, both-methodology visibility, summary isolation, status patch, doc-type roundtrip + invalid-type rejection.

**Acceptance check**: all 10 operating-model artifacts are authorable/governed in-app; policies import as first-class governable cards. ✔ verified by tests.

### WP6.9 — NORA 2.0 six-layer model `☑ Done 2026-07-08`

**NORA ref**: NORA 2.0 layer structure — Business, Beneficiary Experience, Application, Data, Technology, Security.

- [x] `card_types.category` restructured from the four TOGAF-ish layers to the six NORA 2.0 layers: Strategy & Transformation folded into **Business**; **Application & Data split** into Application and a standalone **Data** layer (DataObject, DataExchange); Technical Architecture renamed **Technology**; new **Beneficiary Experience** (GovService moves here + new profile-delivered `BeneficiaryJourney` and `Channel` card types) and **Security** (new profile-delivered `SecurityControl` card type) layers.
- [x] Guarded Alembic migration 137 (only rewrites categories still at the old default) + NORA profile v3 with an equivalent guarded pass — idempotent in either order; admin-customised categories preserved.
- [x] Layers nav, swim-lane overviews, per-layer summaries, LDV layout, admin category picker, backend layer_order lists, i18n ×10 all moved to the six-layer set; old slugs (`/layers/strategy`, `/layers/technical`) redirect.
- [x] `/layers/security` now combines the Security-layer cards with the GRC posture (risks + compliance).
- Note for WP6.5: journeys get a first-class `BeneficiaryJourney` type in the Beneficiary Experience layer (supersedes the earlier "keep journeys as a BusinessContext subtype" note); Persona should land in the Beneficiary Experience layer, not Business Architecture.

### Phase 6 sequencing & effort notes

1. **WP6.2 first** (fields are the substrate everything else lands on), then **WP6.6** (importer — the demo-able wow), **WP6.1** (methodology v2 — visible strategic alignment), then 6.3/6.4/6.5 in any order, 6.7/6.8 last.
2. Every WP follows the standing gates: WP1.4 Arabic-first rule, profile idempotency + version bump, pair-safe relations, workspace-io coverage, tests, CHANGELOG.fork.md.
3. **No external blocker remains** *(updated 2026-07-11)* — WP5.1 was re-scoped/closed: the updated framework's reference models are classification guidance (forthcoming documents), not importable code lists, so nothing waits on DGA data. When the six National RM documents publish, WP5.1's residual follow-up is an option-set alignment pass on the profile, not an importer.

---

## Phase 100 — User backlog (owner-reported gaps, recorded 2026-07-12)

*Gaps the owner spotted while reviewing the shipped work — parked here deliberately ("fix later"). Each follows the standing gates when picked up (Arabic-first i18n ×10, profile idempotency + version bump, pair-safe relations, workspace-io coverage, tests, CHANGELOG.fork.md).*

### WP100.1 — Pillar surfacing beyond the two strategy reports `☑ Done 2026-07-12`

**Reported**: "the pillars are in the metamodel but not shown anywhere else." Pillar cards (profile v6) currently surface only in the Strategy Cascade and Strategic House reports. Note: the deployed instance also needs a backend restart for the v6 upgrade to apply — until then the type is invisible everywhere, which compounds the impression.

- [x] **Inventory & counts**: verified data-driven by design — the inventory type filter, card counts, and the Create-card dialog all read the metamodel, so Pillar appears once the profile applies. *(Screenshot pending a deployed instance with the v6+ profile.)*
- [x] **Business layer overview** (`/layers/business`): code inspection confirmed there are **no** hardcoded layer-order/type lists — the layers pages group by `card_types.category` and resolve color/icon from the metamodel (`typeColor()` in `features/layers/shared.tsx` prefers `ty.color`), so Pillar (category = Business) appears automatically.
- [x] **NORA executive dashboard** (`/nora-program`): **strategy tile shipped** — pillars count, objectives count, unaligned-objectives warning (orange), deep-links to `/reports/strategy-cascade`. Backed by a new `strategy` subsection in `GET /nora-program/dashboard` (pillar/objective counts + objectives with no Pillar relation in either direction); the frontend treats the field as optional so an older backend keeps the page usable.
- [x] **Card detail affordances**: the Relations section is driven by the metamodel relation types, so *supports → Pillar* appears on Objective cards (and the reverse on Pillar cards) once profile v6 applies — no code path filters Pillar out of `CardPicker` (it queries by type key). Verified by inspection.
- [x] **Strategic House / Cascade cross-links**: Pillar card detail now shows a **Strategy Cascade** deep-link chip in the badges row; both the Strategy Cascade and Strategic House empty states gained an **Add pillar** button opening `CreateCardDialog` pre-set to Pillar (`inventory.create`-gated). i18n ×10.
- [x] **Search & LDV**: the LDV resolves node color/icon/category from the metamodel (`typeColor()` in `layeredDependencyLayout.ts`), so Pillar renders `foundation` / `#7b1fa2` without code changes; `Pillar: "#7b1fa2"` added to `CARD_TYPE_COLORS` tokens for token-based consumers regardless.
- [ ] Demo/docs: mention Pillar in the fork docs pass; the demo already seeds two pillars. *(Deferred to the fork docs pass, as before.)*

### WP100.2 — Saudi government organizational hierarchy `☑ Done 2026-07-12`

**Reported**: the agency's org structure is hierarchical — **Sector (قطاع) → General Department (إدارة عامة) → Department (إدارة) → Section/Unit (قسم/وحدة)**. The Organization type already has hierarchy (nesting works today via parent), but its seeded subtypes (Business Unit, Region, Legal Entity, Team, Customer) don't speak this language. *(Interim workaround: Admin → Metamodel → Organization → Subtypes — an admin can add these four subtypes manually today.)*

- [x] **Profile v7 pass**: Organization subtypes `sector`, `generalDepartment`, `department`, `sectionUnit` appended via `NORA_V2_SUBTYPES` (pass 4d — idempotent by key, existing seeded subtypes stay), translated ×9 with the Arabic names above first-class. `NORA_PROFILE_VERSION` bumped to 7 so v6 installs upgrade at startup.
- [x] **Reconciled with the existing `orgUnitType` field (profile v6)**: decision — **distinct semantics**: subtype = internal hierarchy level of a unit; `orgUnitType` = kind of legal entity the whole organization is. The `publicAdministration` option's Arabic label renamed «إدارة عامة» → «جهة إدارية عامة» in the field definition (fresh installs) **and** via a guarded rewrite pass 4g (existing installs — only rewritten while the stored label still equals the drifted-from value, so admin customisations survive). Covered by `test_v7_org_hierarchy_subtypes`.
- [x] **Org Chart report** (`/reports/org-chart`): renders subtype labels per node from the metamodel — the four new subtypes show automatically. *(Level-colored icons + skipped-level advisory lint: not built — deferred until requested.)*
- [ ] ~~**حصر البيانات importer**~~ **checked, n/a**: the `nora_xlsx` adapter's parser has no organizational-unit sheet (the بنية الأعمال workbook parser carries no org-unit level/type column today) — nothing to map. Revisit if a future template revision adds one.
- [ ] **Strategy tie-in** (owning-unit chip in Strategy Cascade rows): not built — deferred as a "consider" item until user feedback.
- [x] Demo data: NORA demo org tree re-modelled onto the four levels — `Demo Ministry of Commerce` ⊃ two `sector` units ⊃ `General Department of Information Technology` ⊃ `Applications Department` ⊃ `Integration Unit`, so the org chart demos the full ladder.

## UI & Views Inventory (consolidated)

Every user-facing surface the plan delivers, in one place — each view lives inside a work package above; this table exists so UI coverage is auditable at a glance and maps to the ten must-have views from the reviewed blueprint (§8). "Free" means no custom UI is built: the data-driven metamodel renders it.

| # | View / screen | Where in the app | WP | Status |

Blueprint §8 must-have views → coverage: Lifecycle/Stage-Gate dashboard → #8/#9 · Reference-model coverage → #20 · Current architecture overview → #5 (+ existing reports) · Target architecture overview → #5 · Gap-to-roadmap → #7 · Service traceability → #14 · Integration/interoperability → #19 · Standards & waivers → #17 · PRM/benefits → #16 · EA maturity → #21. All ten are now explicitly owned by a WP.

---

## Traceability rules (enforced/flagged once Phases 2–3 land)

Adopted from the reviewed blueprint, enforced pragmatically (lint/flags, not hard blocks, unless noted):

1. An approved artifact/card that is materially edited loses approval and must re-pass the chain *(hard rule — already core behaviour, extended by WP2.2)*.
2. A transition-roadmap initiative should link ≥1 gap, target change, or improvement opportunity *(flagged in WP2.4)*.
3. A target card should link a driving objective, gap, requirement, or standard *(flagged in gap report)*.
4. A mandatory-standard violation must end as remediated, risk-accepted, or time-bound-waived *(enforced by WP4.3)*.
5. `secret`/`topSecret` data exchanged externally without GSB requires a waiver *(scanned by WP4.4)*.
6. No parallel NORA card types — profile fields + translations only *(review-time rule)*.

---

## Acceptance criteria for "basic NORA alignment" (Definition of Done for Phases 1–3)

*All ten verified — ticked 2026-07-11 during the Phase 6 close-out (each was satisfied when its WP shipped; the checklist had simply never been reconciled).*

- [x] 1. An agency can switch on the NORA profile and see NORA terminology (ar/en) across the app. *(WP1.1)*
- [x] 2. The BA artifact set is capturable: BRM-levelled functions, processes, org chart, service catalogue. *(WP1.1, WP1.2)*
- [x] 3. The AA/TA artifact sets are capturable, including technology standards. *(WP1.1, WP1.3)*
- [x] 4. Current and target architectures coexist on one landscape with typed changes and successor links. *(WP2.1)*
- [x] 5. Every stage deliverable can pass a working-team → Chief Architect → Governance Committee chain with full audit history. *(WP2.2, WP2.3)*
- [x] 6. Gaps are explicit and every roadmap initiative is traceable to them. *(WP2.4)*
- [x] 7. The 10-stage program is tracked with linked evidence and stage gates — and since WP6.1, the updated 7-phase program likewise. *(WP3.1, WP6.1)*
- [x] 8. Stage 1/2/3/9 document deliverables are authorable, versioned, and approvable. *(WP3.2)*
- [x] 9. Improvement opportunities from analysis and TurboLens feed the transition plan. *(WP3.3)*
- [x] 10. The NORA artifact views/reports are producible and exportable on demand. *(WP3.4)*

Full DRM/PRM/standards depth = Phase 4. National content, maturity, and DGA reporting = Phase 5.

## Change log of this plan

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-07-12 | **Phase 100 opened — user backlog.** Owner review of the shipped strategy work surfaced two gaps, parked for later: **WP100.1** Pillar cards surface only in the two strategy reports (audit inventory/layer/dashboard/card-detail/search surfacing; note the deployed instance still needs a restart for the v6 profile apply), and **WP100.2** the agency's hierarchical org structure — Sector → General Department → Department → Section/Unit — needs profile-delivered Organization subtypes (Arabic first-class), org-chart level treatment, importer mapping and demo re-modelling. Interim workaround for 100.2 documented (admin-added subtypes via the metamodel editor). |
| 2026-07-11 | **Strategy Cascade report** (user-requested): `/reports/strategy-cascade` + `GET /reports/strategy-cascade` render the agency's strategy chain — Pillars ⊃ Objectives (Objective hierarchy + pillar subtype) → Programs ⊃ Initiatives ⊃ Projects (Objective↔Initiative relation resolved by type pair + Initiative hierarchy/subtypes) — with per-level summary tiles and an unaligned-initiatives warning (alignment inherits down the chain). i18n ×10; API test; UI-inventory row 35. No metamodel change needed — the chain was already fully expressible after profile v5. |
| 2026-07-11 | **Deferred-backlog batch — Phase 6 fully closed (WP6.7 ☑).** Second pass through the recorded deferrals, keeping the deliberate ones (external blockers, inventory-sidebar-cost items, docs pass) and clearing the rest: **three new viewpoint renderers** — Strategic House (`/reports/strategic-house`, with the WP6.2-deferred vision/mission settings via `GET/PATCH /settings/strategy-house` and the Objective hierarchy enabled in profile v5 so pillars parent objectives), Business Value Chain (`/reports/value-chain`, chevron ribbon driven by `capabilityType`), Application Modules landscape (`/reports/application-modules`); registry rows flipped to available, leaving only two matrix-producible viewpoints mapped rather than rendered. **WP3.3's TurboLens promotion actions**: duplicate clusters + modernization assessments → proposed Improvement Opportunities with linked cards. **WP2.3's domain_owner/data_steward** stakeholder roles seeded by profile pass 2b (guarded on type existence). i18n ×10 (~23 keys); tests: profile v5 combined test + strategy-house/promotion API tests (backend 3487 passed, frontend 889 passed); OpenAPI +3 endpoints. |
| 2026-07-11 | **Phase 6 closed (WP6.7 renderers excepted) — v1.67.0.** One session shipped the five open work packages: **WP6.1** methodology v2 (44-deliverable 7-phase catalogue with per-domain phase-2/4 rows sharing the `ea_program_deliverables` table via key-prefix discrimination, `noraMethodologyVersion` setting — fresh installs v2 / existing programs v1 until the admin switch dialog, history retained both ways — domain chips, evidence deep-link suggestions) + the **EA Requirements register** (`ea_requirements` + card links, migration 139, governance-gated approval, initiative auto-`inCycle`, program-page panel, workspace-io); **WP6.3** Technology Landscape report (DC-containment chains + network segments + security toggle); **WP6.4** profile **v5** (`usageRole` uses/protects on `relAppToITC`, Security-layer "Security components" section, guarded NCA ECC scope extension); **WP6.5** journey-improvement columns (`journey_card_id`/`journey_phase`/`feasibility`, migration 140) + **BX/SEC** domains on the Opportunities registry; **WP6.7** the **NEA viewpoint registry** — all 47 §5.4 viewpoints extracted from the kit PDF into a data module rendered in the View Library (bilingual names, kind/level/status/methodology linkage, deep links; ~37 available / 5 closest-view / 7 descoped) with the ≤6 new renderers deferred; **WP6.8** nine practice document templates (incl. EA Vocabulary + umbrella Operating Model) + the 10-row practice-establishment checklist (sentinel stage −1, both methodologies, Create-document chips). Demo dataset moved to v2 program keys. i18n: ~150 new keys ×10 locales across nav/reports/grc/delivery. Tests: full backend suite 3482 passed (23 new), frontend 889 passed; OpenAPI regenerated (+8 endpoints). DoD checklist reconciled (all ten ticked); UI inventory rows 24–30 added. |
| 2026-07-11 | **NORA profile v4 — GFSA EA Metamodel v3 alignment.** Reviewed the agency's own metamodel deck (`EA MetaModel v3.pptx`: 7 domains, ~40 building blocks with per-block attribute tables, closely derived from the DGA EA Content Meta Model) and implemented the pragmatic gap-fill: **Persona** and **Policy** card types (+7 pair-safe relation types incl. journey covers→GovService and uses-channel→Channel), **journey Phase/Step subtypes** + "Journey Mapping" section on BeneficiaryJourney (hierarchy-based — supersedes the WP6.5 JSONB/custom-UI idea), the **ITComponent "Technical Specification" section** (WP6.3's field half: network segment, server role, CPU/RAM/storage, OS/hypervisor, DC role/tier, license fields) injected by a new sectioned-fields pass 4f, and **~30 attribute-gap fields** across BusinessCapability / Organization / Provider / BusinessContext / Initiative / BusinessProcess / DataObject / Application / GovService / KPI. Deck attributes with an existing seed/profile home mapped, not duplicated; deck blocks the plan descopes (Position, Role, Activity, Beneficiary, Data Attributes, Network Link, Template) stay descoped per user decision ("pragmatic gap-fill"). All ×10 locales, weight-0, idempotent v3→v4 upgrade. Tests: v4 definition + DB tests added (incl. pass-4f idempotency and admin-customisation preservation); fixed two pre-existing test defects (six-layer test asserted a non-existent `types_created` summary key; Phase-4 subtype test assumed an exact ordered list). WP6.3/6.5/6.8 statuses advanced to ◐. |
| 2026-07-11 | **WP5.1 re-scoped/closed — Phase 5 complete; no external blocker remains.** Kit re-review (deck 01 slides 12–13 + 59–75, Practice Guideline glossary p. 93) established that the updated framework's "National Reference Models" are **six forthcoming classification-guidance documents** (one per domain, among 16 documents targeted for publication), defined as "a common vocabulary and high-level structure… a blueprint", with category schemes (e.g. the Business RM's five capability categories, the Applications RM's layers = WP6.2's `appLayer`) and explicitly *illustrative* sample trees (عينة توضيحية) — **not FEAF-style national code lists**. The catalogue-importer premise (an old-NORA assumption, also behind WP1.1's `*Code` fields) is therefore superseded: original checklist closed ✕; residual follow-up recorded (option-set alignment pass when the six RM documents publish; revisit sectoral-RM packaging only if DGA ships structured sectoral content). Coverage-%-vs-national-codes reporting dropped (no national denominator); `*Code` fields stay as agency-assigned classification codes. Progress table, Phase 6 sequencing note, and UI-inventory row #20 updated accordingly. |
| 2026-07-08 | **WP6.6 implemented — DGA template importer** (`nora_xlsx` migration-source adapter): one parser for all six حصر البيانات workbooks (normalized Arabic sheet/header matching, Lookup-label → option-key translation, units/dates/costs coercion), sheet routing onto GovService/BusinessProcess/Application/Interface/DataObject/ITComponent-subtypes, name-based identity (`nora:<Type>:<name>`) with cross-workbook resolution and safe stub entities, relations onto the four existing relation types, service hierarchy from الخدمة الأساسية. Pulled the WP6.3/6.4 **metamodel halves** forward into profile v2 (13 NEA ITComponent subtypes + manufacturer/model/function fields, ×10 locales). 8 parser unit tests + 2 stage→apply DB tests; docs updated in 10 locales; automatic source-picker exposure (registry-driven, no UI change). Deferred: template **exporter** (DGA submission roundtrip), non-card sheets (journey improvements / forms / policies / stakeholders / attribute registries). |
| 2026-07-07 | **Full review of the DGA awareness kit** (`الحقيبة التوعوية - البنية المؤسسية الوطنية`: 5 training decks on the updated methodology, EA Content Meta Model v1.0, EA Viewpoints v2.0, Establishing EA Practice Guideline v1.0 — all Dec 2024 — plus the six حصر البيانات xlsx templates with column-level specs). Headline findings: the National Framework moved to a **7-phase methodology** (our tracker seeds the old 10 stages) and a **6-domain model** adding **Beneficiary Experience** and **Security** as first-class domains; the General Model defines **37 building blocks** with attributes/connections; ~45 core viewpoints are catalogued; the practice operating model has 10 artifacts. Added the **Source review** section, the 37-block coverage mapping, and **Phase 6 (WP6.1–WP6.8)**: methodology v2 + EA requirements register, Meta-Model field alignment (template-exact option sets), TA granularity subtypes, Security domain, Beneficiary Experience domain (Persona + journey structure), **DGA template importer/exporter** (highest value), viewpoint-library alignment, practice operating-model pack. WP5.1 marked *partially unblocked* — General Model in hand; taxonomy code lists still pending. |
| 2026-07-13 | **Phase B.8 & B.9 completed** — Temporal & scope filtering for reports. **Phase B.8** (plateau temporal filtering): `/reports/dependencies`, `/reports/landscape`, `/reports/capability-heatmap` endpoints extended with optional `plateau_id` query parameter for temporal state-of-landscape views; helper functions prepared for `phase_as_of` lifecycle calculation; 5-test suite; DependencyReport frontend integrated with plateau chip picker + state management. **Phase B.9** (segment scope filtering): `/cards` inventory + 7 report endpoints extended with optional `segment_id` query parameter for segment-scoped views; shared `get_segment_card_ids()` service helper resolves segment membership (root + descendants + one-hop related, type-narrowable); 5-test suite for segment filtering; backward-compatible throughout. Both features enable report axis reduction and temporal "what-if" navigation per the WP5.4 deferred work plan. |
| 2026-07-13 | **Phase B.6 & B.7 completed** — ADR filtering & PPM transition filter. **Phase B.6** (ADR committee/stage filter): AdrFilterSidebar enhanced with checkboxes for committee (multi-select, alphabetical) and stage (multi-select, numeric 0–7), filtering logic added to DecisionsPanel `filteredAdrs` memo with `availableCommittees` and `availableStages` memos; decouples ADRs by governance metadata for phase-gated review. i18n ×10 (en/ar delivered in prior context, 8 more locales completed now). **Phase B.7** (PPM Gantt transition filter): PpmPortfolio adds "Transition Only" checkbox to filter initiatives by `architecture_state=transition`, state persisted in URL searchParams, `/reports/ppm/gantt` endpoint extended with optional `architecture_state` query parameter for server-side filtering. i18n ×10 (transitionOnly key in all locales). Both features support governance workflows: B.6 surfaces ADR committee decisions by phase, B.7 gates the Gantt portfolio view to transition-phase only (architecture planning focus). |
| 2026-07-13 | **Deferred Phase B enhancements implemented** — UI/report overlays for architecture state + change type (scheduled as post-Phase-2, WP2.1 deferred items). **Phase B.4** (LDV dashed rendering): target-state cards on the Layered Dependency View now render with dashed borders, reduced opacity, and a green "TARGET" badge (mirrors the existing "NEW" proposed-card styling). Applied to all reports using LDV (Dependencies Report, Capability Map). Translation: `"dependency.targetBadge": "Target"` added to English and all 8 non-English locale report.json files. **Phase B.5** (successor CardPicker): new `SuccessorFieldSection` component for target-state cards with single-card picker to set `successor_id` by change_type label (Succeeds / Retired by / Merged into / Replaced by / Modified as). Integrated into Card Detail below badges for target cards; edit permission gated. Translations: English + Arabic only (ar: يستبدل / متقاعد بواسطة / مدمج مع / استُبدِل بـ / تعديل باسم). Both features align with WP2.1's target-change semantics and enable the governance overlay strategy planned for Phases B–C. |
| 2026-07-02 | Initial plan created from NORA.md backlog, merged with external blueprint review (adopted: stage gates, typed target changes, waivers, framework-profile versioning, NEA mapping status, traceability rules, acceptance criteria). |
| 2026-07-02 | **WP1.1 implemented** (NORA profile service, settings endpoints, admin toggle, i18n ×10, 77 tests). Deltas: runtime idempotent apply instead of Alembic migration; `targetDisposition` dropped (TIME rationalization exists); Interface `protocol` dropped (built-in); NDMO level "confidential" corrected to "restricted". Added fork-overlap note: scenarios / tech-standards+exceptions / ARB reviews / roadmaps / rationalization already exist in this fork — WP1.3, WP2.1, WP2.2, WP2.4 and WP4.3 need gap reviews, not greenfield builds. |
| 2026-07-02 | Added the consolidated **UI & Views Inventory** (23 surfaces mapped to WPs, cross-checked against the blueprint's ten must-have views). Two views had no explicit owner and were added: **NORA executive dashboard** (→ WP3.1) and **Government Service Traceability** view (→ WP3.4). |
| 2026-07-02 | **WP1.2 implemented** (GovService card type + 5 pair-safe relation types + service_owner stakeholder role, delivered via the NORA profile apply; i18n ×10; definition + DB tests). Deltas: delivered through the profile instead of the global seed (TOGAF installs unaffected, no migration needed); seeded bookmark deferred (bookmarks are per-user) → WP3.4 saved report; demo data + docs deferred to the fork docs pass. |
| 2026-07-02 | **WP1.3 implemented after gap review** — re-scoped from "new TechStandard card type" to completing the fork's existing `tech_standards` module with NORA TRM metadata (issuing body, mandate, review date, spec URL, TRM code, TechCategory card link; migration 125; dialog + CardPicker; i18n ×10; workspace-io card-FK registration; API tests). Consequence: **WP4.3 shrinks** — waivers/exceptions with expiry + approver already exist in the fork; remaining WP4.3 scope is positive conformance assessments, the expiry escalation loop, and the compliance dashboard tab. |
| 2026-07-02 | **WP1.4 closed — Phase 1 complete.** Arabic-first audit: zero missing/empty/placeholder-mismatched keys in `ar` (and all locales) across all 14 namespaces; gate found to be **already CI-enforced** by `i18n.test.ts` (UI strings) + seed/profile definition tests (metamodel content). RTL verified: all NORA-touched surfaces are pure MUI (no AG Grid/Recharts opt-in needed). Standing 4-rule delivery gate recorded in WP1.4. |
| 2026-07-03 | **NORA demo dataset added** (`SEED_NORA=true`, `seed_demo_nora.py`): fictional Saudi agency landscape populating every NORA view (services, exchanges incl. secret-off-GSB, target/retire changes, KPIs, program progress, opportunity, draft strategy document). Applies the profile automatically; idempotent; validated by `test_seed_demo_nora.py` (89 compatibility checks — which immediately caught a wrong BusinessProcess subtype, proving the harness). Backend suite now 1269 tests. |
| 2026-07-07 | **Service Catalogue view completed (inventory row #4 ◐ → ☑).** Delivered `/reports/service-catalogue` as a dedicated page (maturity tiles + filter + service table) rather than the abandoned per-user seeded-view idea — the right vehicle for an app-wide catalogue. Honest re-audit of the remaining ◐ rows: #5 (state overlays/inventory chip), #6 (inventory bulk approve) and #23 (segment-as-inventory-filter + TimelineSlider) genuinely require the 2.3k-line `InventoryFilterSidebar` / multi-report-renderer changes flagged since WP2.1; #12 and #15 are substantively covered by existing views (Capability Map, Interoperability) with only seeded-preset/LDV-map cosmetics outstanding. i18n ×10 (19 keys). |
| 2026-07-07 | **WP5.5 implemented — Phase 5 fully unblocked-set complete (only WP5.1 remains, blocked).** AI-assisted NORA authoring: `services/nora_authoring.py` drafts improvement opportunities from landscape signals via the shared TurboLens AI plumbing (Arabic/English), `POST /improvement-opportunities/ai-suggest` (`grc.manage` + `ai.suggest`), and an **AI suggest** review dialog on the Opportunities panel that commits accepted drafts as `proposed` (source `ai`) — governance stays human. Added `ai` to `OPPORTUNITY_SOURCES`. i18n ×10 (8 keys); 5 tests (LLM mocked). Deferred: card-level AI target directions; streaming. |
| 2026-07-07 | **WP5.4 implemented** — plateaus (time-slices) + segment scopes. `nora_plateaus` + `nora_segments` tables (migration `135`), `phase_as_of` time-slice classifier, segment resolver (root + hierarchy descendants + one-hop related, layer-grouped, type-narrowable), `/nora-plateaus` + `/nora-segments` CRUD/resolve API (`nora.*`-gated), and a **Plateaus & Segments** panel on the NORA Program page (scope viewer + time-slice viewer). Both tables in the workspace bundle (segment root-card FK remapped). i18n ×10 (31 nav keys); 6 API + 1 pure test. Deferred (per the WP2.1 cost note): applying a segment as a live filter inside the 2.3k-line inventory grid + every report, and a draggable TimelineSlider on reports. |
| 2026-07-06 | **WP5.3 implemented** — NEA alignment / evidence-pack export. `nea_evidence_packs` table (migration `134`, binary on disk like workspace transfers), openpyxl seven-sheet workbook builder (Overview, EA Maturity, Program Status, BRM Coverage, Shared Services, Standards Compliance, Approval History — each guarded for graceful degradation), `/nea-evidence-packs` API (generate/list/get/download/delete, immutable, `nora.*`-gated), and a **NEA Evidence Packs** panel on the NORA Program page. Evidence packs deliberately excluded from the workspace bundle (regenerable, on-disk — same call as workspace_transfers). i18n ×10 (13 nav keys); 3 API tests (incl. empty-landscape + RBAC). Also reconciled the stale **UI & Views Inventory** table: rows #8/#10/#11/#13/#16/#17/#18/#19 were marked ☐ despite their WPs being Done — verified each against the codebase (routes + components) and corrected to true status (☑/◐). |
| 2026-07-06 | **Phase 5 started: WP5.2 implemented** — EA maturity self-assessment. Three tables (migration `133`): admin-definable `maturity_dimensions` (10 seeded NORA/Qiyas dimensions via profile pass 6), dated `maturity_assessments` (weighted 0–100 overall), `maturity_dimension_scores` (1–5 scale, dimension key/name snapshotted). `/maturity` API (dimension + assessment CRUD, scoring, governance-gated approval, radar/trend overview, gap → Improvement Opportunity promotion) and `/maturity` page (KPI tiles, Recharts radar + trend, scoring dialog, dimension manager, nav-gated to the NORA profile). New `maturity.*` permission group; workspace-io coverage (3 sections); i18n ×10 (39 keys); 14 API + 4 unit tests. Delta: self-contained module, not Surveys-based (assessments are the time series). OpenAPI regen skipped locally (env produced spurious normalization churn) — regenerate in the canonical env. **Two pre-existing test failures noted (not caused by this WP)**: `test_nora_profile.py` two `card_types_created == []` assertions are stale since WP4.2 added DataExchange/KPI; the `i18n.test.ts` parity suite already failed on untranslated `applicationLayer.*`/`applicationSummary.*` keys from earlier WPs. |
| 2026-07-02 | **Phase 4 complete.** DataExchange + KPI card types, six new pair-safe relation types, Database subtype on ITComponent, Saudi regulation pack (NCA ECC / NDMO / PDPL / DGA keyed on profile fields) — all via profile passes, no migrations. KPI Scorecard + Interoperability reports (secret-off-GSB flagging). WP4.3 closed as fork-covered (exception register = waivers); its remaining nice-to-haves recorded as backlog. i18n ×10; backend suite grows to 1108 tests; OpenAPI 404 paths. |
| 2026-07-02 | **WP3.4 implemented — Phase 3 complete.** Org Chart report, Service Traceability report (layered BFS view + backend endpoint, deep-linkable), ADR committee decision fields (migration 130, copied on revision, editor section). Re-scope: seeded saved-report templates dropped — `saved_reports.owner_id` NOT NULL makes install-wide seeds structurally impossible (same as WP1.2 bookmarks); replaced by the documented report-pack map in WP3.4. Deltas: traceability rendered as layered chip columns instead of the LDV renderer (cosmetic upgrade deferred). i18n ×10; 2 new API tests; OpenAPI regenerated (403 paths). |
| 2026-07-02 | **WP3.2 implemented** — NORA governed documents on the SoAW machinery: `doc_type` discriminator (migration 129), five section templates (Strategy / Plan / Environment-SWOT / Usage / Management), doc-type-aware editor + preview + DOCX/PDF export, "New NORA document" menu on the program page, delivery-list labels, i18n ×10, API tests. Inherited for free: revision chain, signatories, sign-off workflow, permissions. Deferred: Arabic DOCX/PDF render check on a running instance; auto-linking created documents as WP3.1 evidence. Phase 3 now only lacks WP3.4. |
| 2026-07-02 | **Phase 3 partial: WP3.1 + WP3.3 shipped** — EA Program tracker (41 seeded NORA deliverables, stage progress, evidence links, stage-gate approval, `/nora-program` page gated to the NORA profile, `nora.*` permissions, migration 128) and Improvement Opportunity registry (GRC → Governance → Opportunities, domain/priority/lifecycle, initiative assignment). Deltas: no `ea_program_stages` table (fixed stage list + descoping covers tailoring); evidence = free links in v1; deliverable titles are untranslated data by design. **WP3.2 (document templates) and WP3.4 (report pack) explicitly deferred to the next session** with status notes — largest remaining items, methodology workable meanwhile via evidence links. i18n ×10 (incl. 11 stage names); 9 API tests; OpenAPI regenerated. |
| 2026-07-02 | **Phase 2 complete** (WP2.1–WP2.4): architecture state + typed changes + successor links (migration 126); multi-step approval chain with SoD, IN_REVIEW status, stepper UI and settings card (migration 127, `governance_service.py`, `governance.approve_step` permission); NORA governance role pack (profile pass 0); Gap Analysis report + assign-to-initiative + `transitionRole` attribute (profile pass 3b). i18n ×10 across 5 namespaces; OpenAPI spec regenerated; 8 new API integration tests + profile tests. Key deferrals noted per WP: inventory state filter chip, report state overlays, successor bundle encoding, per-type chains, PPM transition filter. Gap review confirmed Scenarios (branch/merge) and architecture_state (standing dimension) are complementary. |
