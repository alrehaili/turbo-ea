**Progress legend**

| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ Done | View exists and is reachable at the given link (NORA-preset seeded) |
| 🟢 Available | Engine covers it today, but the NORA preset/saved view is not seeded yet |
| 🟡 Partial | Generic engine can render it after configuration (relation/subtype/preset work needed) |
| ❌ Missing | Requires new building blocks (card types/relations) or a new renderer |

**Overall: 0 / 67 done** · 20 available · 22 partial · 25 missing

**Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
- ViewpointDefinition model & table (migration 154)
- All 67 NORA viewpoints seeded with metadata
- `/api/v1/viewpoints` endpoints + frontend `/view-library` page live
- Ready for Phase 2 (add missing building blocks)

---

## Implementation phases

### Phase 1 — View Library + presets (no schema changes)
1. Add a data-driven **ViewpointDefinition registry** (seeded table or JSON seed) with code, bilingual name, domain, level, type, description, stakeholders, building blocks, and target route.
2. Add **`/view-library`** page (top-level route, not under `/reports`): grid grouped by domain → level → type, each card showing progress badge + "Open view" link (the links in the tables below).
3. Seed saved views/presets for all 🟢 Available rows → flips them to ✅.

### Phase 2 — Business & Beneficiary building blocks
Add `GovService`, `Beneficiary`, `BeneficiaryPersona`, `BeneficiaryJourney` (+ stages/touchpoints), `ModelTemplate`, `Policy`, `Position/Mandate` mapping, and their relation types (seed + migration). Unblocks 16 ❌ rows and several 🟡 rows.

### Phase 3 — Data, infrastructure & security semantics
Add/standardize `DataTerm`, `DataAttribute`, `DataVault`, `Datacenter`, `Location`, `NetworkCircuit`, `SecurityService`, `SecurityFunction`, plus subtypes `Server`, `NetworkDevice`, `Storage`, `PhysicalHost`, `SecuritySoftware`, `SecurityHardware`.

### Phase 4 — Specialized generated diagrams
New renderers: Strategic House, Beneficiary Journey Map, Datacenter Distribution, Network Topology/Circuits, Security Deployment. Reuse the LDV/React-Flow and report-shell infrastructure; one registry, reusable renderers — no 67 hard-coded pages.

## How to update this file

- When a viewpoint's NORA preset ships, change its Progress to **✅ Done** and make the Link a real route (with the saved-report/bookmark id if applicable).
- Update the **Overall** counter and per-domain `(n/total)` headings.
- New routes introduced by Phase 4 renderers replace the "(planned)" placeholders.

## Phase 1 Deliverables (Completed)

### Implemented
1. **ViewpointDefinition model** (`backend/app/models/viewpoint_definition.py`) — governs all 67 viewpoints
   - Columns: code, name_en/ar, domain, level, type, description_en/ar, building_blocks (JSONB), target_route, status, sort_order
   - Indices on code (unique) and domain
2. **Migration 154** — creates `viewpoint_definitions` table
3. **Seed data** (`backend/app/services/seed_viewpoints.py`) — all 67 NORA viewpoints seeded on startup
4. **API** (`backend/app/api/v1/viewpoints.py`)
   - `GET /viewpoints?domain=X&level=Y&status=Z&page=1&page_size=50` — paginated list with filters
   - `GET /viewpoints/{code}` — single viewpoint detail
5. **Frontend** (`frontend/src/features/view-library/ViewLibraryPage.tsx`)
   - Route: `/view-library`
   - Grid grouped by domain → level, filterable
   - Progress badges (✅ Done · 🟢 Available · 🟡 Partial · ❌ Missing)
   - Click card → navigate to target route or alert if missing
   - Bilingual (en/ar), showing building blocks

### How to Test
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && alembic upgrade head
# Restart app — seed runs, migration applied

# Frontend
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173/view-library
# Filter by domain/level, click cards to navigate or see what's missing
```

### What's Left
- **Phase 2**: Add missing building blocks (GovService, Beneficiary, Persona, Journey, ModelTemplate, Policy, etc.)
- **Phase 3**: Add infrastructure/data/security subtypes and standardized relations
- **Phase 4**: Build specialized renderers (Strategic House, Journey Map, Network Topology, Security Deployment, etc.)
