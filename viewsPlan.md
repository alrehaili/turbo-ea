**Progress legend**

| Icon | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ Done | View exists and is reachable at the given link (NORA-preset seeded) |
| 🟢 Available | Engine covers it today, but the NORA preset/saved view is not seeded yet |
| 🟡 Partial | Generic engine can render it after configuration (relation/subtype/preset work needed) |
| ❌ Missing | Requires new building blocks (card types/relations) or a new renderer |

**Overall: 0 / 67 done** · 38 available · 11 partial · 18 missing

**Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
- ViewpointDefinition model & table (migration 154)
- All 67 NORA viewpoints seeded with metadata
- `/api/v1/viewpoints` endpoints + frontend `/view-library` page live

**Phase 2 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Added 7 building block card types (GovService, Beneficiary, BeneficiaryPersona, BeneficiaryJourney, ModelTemplate, Policy, Position)
- Added 9 relation types linking them (GovService→Org/Template/Process/App/Persona/Journey, Beneficiary→Persona, Persona→Journey, Org→Position)
- Unblocked 16 viewpoints (Business 14/14 ✅, Beneficiary 7/8, all matrices now seedable)
- **Ready for testing**: `/view-library` now shows all Business/Beneficiary viewpoints as 🟢 Available

**Phase 3 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
- Added 8 building block card types (DataTerm, DataAttribute, DataVault, Datacenter, Location, NetworkCircuit, SecurityService, SecurityFunction)
- All types include subtypes: DataVault (database/dataLake/warehouse), Datacenter (onPremise/cloudRegion/edgeLocation), NetworkCircuit (leased/internet/mpls), SecurityFunction (preventive/detective/corrective)
- Added 10 relation types (DataTermToAttribute, DataVaultToLocation, DatacenterToLocation, NetworkCircuitToDatacenter, ITComponentToLocation, SecurityServiceToProvider, SecurityFunctionToApp, SecurityFunctionToITComponent, AppToDataVault, AppToNetworkCircuit, DataVaultToDomain)
- Unblocks Technology (11/12), Data (4/8), Security (6/8) viewpoints
- All new types carry bilingual (en/ar) metadata with complete fields_schema

## Implementation phases

### Phase 1 — View Library + presets (no schema changes)
1. Add a data-driven **ViewpointDefinition registry** (seeded table or JSON seed) with code, bilingual name, domain, level, type, description, stakeholders, building blocks, and target route.
2. Add **`/view-library`** page (top-level route, not under `/reports`): grid grouped by domain → level → type, each card showing progress badge + "Open view" link (the links in the tables below).
3. Seed saved views/presets for all 🟢 Available rows → flips them to ✅.

### Phase 2 — Business & Beneficiary building blocks
Add `GovService`, `Beneficiary`, `BeneficiaryPersona`, `BeneficiaryJourney` (+ stages/touchpoints), `ModelTemplate`, `Policy`, `Position/Mandate` mapping, and their relation types (seed + migration). Unblocks 16 ❌ rows and several 🟡 rows.

### Phase 3 — Data, infrastructure & security semantics (✅ COMPLETE)
- Added `DataTerm`, `DataAttribute`, `DataVault`, `Datacenter`, `Location`, `NetworkCircuit`, `SecurityService`, `SecurityFunction` with comprehensive subtypes
- Added 10 relation types (DataTermToAttribute, DataVaultToLocation, DatacenterToLocation, NetworkCircuitToDatacenter, ITComponentToLocation, SecurityServiceToProvider, SecurityFunctionToApp, SecurityFunctionToITComponent, AppToDataVault, AppToNetworkCircuit, DataVaultToDomain)
- All types carry bilingual (en/ar) metadata, hierarchies, and subtypes per NORA domain conventions
- Unblocks Technology (11/12 ✅), Data (4/8 🟢), Security (6/8 🟢) viewpoints for matrix/list rendering

### Phase 4 — Specialized generated diagrams (✅ COMPLETE)
- Built 5 specialized React renderers for NORA diagram viewpoints
- Components: StrategicHouseReport, BeneficiaryJourneyMapReport, DatacenterDistributionReport, NetworkTopologyReport, SecurityDeploymentReport
- All renderers use ReportShell wrapper for consistent layout + MUI responsive grid components
- Routes registered in App.tsx: `/reports/strategic-house-nora`, `/reports/journey-map-nora`, `/reports/datacenter-distribution`, `/reports/network-topology`, `/reports/security-deployment`
- Viewpoint definitions updated to link to new renderers
- Unblocks 5 more viewpoints (Strategic House, Journey Map, Datacenter Distribution, Network Topology, Security Deployment)

## How to update this file

- When a viewpoint's NORA preset ships, change its Progress to **✅ Done** and make the Link a real route (with the saved-report/bookmark id if applicable).
- Update the **Overall** counter and per-domain `(n/total)` headings.
- New routes introduced by Phase 4 renderers replace the "(planned)" placeholders.

## Phase 1 Deliverables (Completed)

### Implemented
1. **ViewpointDefinition model** (`backend/app/models/viewpoint_definition.py`) — governs all 67 viewpoints
   - Columns: code, name_en/ar, domain, level, type, description_en/ar, building_blocks (JSONB), target_route, status, sort_order
   - Indices on code (unique) and domain
2. **Migration 154** — creates `viewpoint_definitions` table
3. **Seed data** (`backend/app/services/seed_viewpoints.py`) — all 67 NORA viewpoints seeded on startup
4. **API** (`backend/app/api/v1/viewpoints.py`)
   - `GET /viewpoints?domain=X&level=Y&status=Z&page=1&page_size=50` — paginated list with filters
   - `GET /viewpoints/{code}` — single viewpoint detail
5. **Frontend** (`frontend/src/features/view-library/ViewLibraryPage.tsx`)
   - Route: `/view-library`
   - Grid grouped by domain → level, filterable
   - Progress badges (✅ Done · 🟢 Available · 🟡 Partial · ❌ Missing)
   - Click card → navigate to target route or alert if missing
   - Bilingual (en/ar), showing building blocks

### How to Test
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && alembic upgrade head
# Restart app — seed runs, migration applied

# Frontend
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173/view-library
# Filter by domain/level, click cards to navigate or see what's missing
```

### What's Next — Remaining Viewpoints (18/67 missing)

The remaining 18 viewpoints require a mix of:
1. **Saved view/preset seeding** (many 🟢 available viewpoints just need NORA-configured saved views/bookmarks to become ✅ done)
2. **New card types** (Mandate, SoAW-linked types, Compliance-specific types)
3. **Matrix preset rendering** (many matrices exist but lack NORA-branded presets)
4. **UI workflow enhancements** (approval workflows, advanced filtering, bulk operations)

**By domain:**
- Strategic Alignment (1/3): Need Pillar type linking
- Beneficiary Experience (1/8): Need Improvement type, Journey-based matrices
- Data (4/8): Need Data Ownership/Steward stakeholder role standardization
- Applications (1/14): Need Application/Beneficiary relation + matrix
- Technology (1/12): Need refined Macro capabilities hierarchy + Node type
- Security (2/8): Mostly needs relation refinements + Security software/hardware linking to applications
